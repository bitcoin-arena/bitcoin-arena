# it when the address has no query), and no deploy put it here - measured: every deploy from
# 0.0.1265 to 0.0.1304 answered /daily.json with the page itself, so the bare root was the
# offline daily. (A full Unity build does not remove it: the build of 0.0.1311, 13:23-13:25, left
# a daily.json already in this folder in place. It was never copied in.) The file is the signer nodes'
# own launcher's, current on every deploy (tools/run-2of2.mjs writes it
# with the tunnels it bonded under), and it is checked before it ships: two signer nodes, a bond door,
# a signed advertisement, and every signer node answering /rounds. A missing file or a silent signer node
# refuses the deploy by name - a lobby that points at silence is not shipped.
