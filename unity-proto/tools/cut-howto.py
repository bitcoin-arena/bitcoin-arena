# DANIEL'S HOW-TO, CUT AT ITS TRUE EDGES (2026-09-14) for the loading screen.
#
# The four tiles that came with it (Assets/Art/Resources/lobby-howto-1..4.png,
# 724x543 each) were cut at the image's half height, y 543. The rows of the
# picture are really separated at y 625-649 (fully transparent there), so tile 1
# lost its bottom - the players and the truck - to tile 3, and tile 2 its bottom
# to tile 4. In 1-2 over 3-4 the strips line up and it cannot be seen; in one
# row it shows (measured on the live page, 1280x800).
#
# So each panel is taken from Daniel's WHOLE (lobby-howto.png, 1448x1086) by the
# box of its own opaque pixels, measured in each quadrant split at the gaps. His
# files are not changed; these go beside the page. The Unity lobby draws the same
# boxes from the whole texture (DailyLobby.PanelBoxes).
