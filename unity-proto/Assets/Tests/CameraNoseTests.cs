/// M1.a14 bullet 1: THE DIRECTION THE TRUCK DRIVES MUST NOT LEAVE THE VIEW.
///
/// a13 measured one case - a keyboard slalom - and took the worst off-nose
/// from 8.7 degrees down to 3.8. One slalom is not "never". The cases that
/// could still break it are the ones a slalom does not contain: driving
/// backwards, a slide where the truck is not going where it points, the frame
/// being thrown by an impact, and the moment a deliberate look lets go.
///
/// ONE CASE PER TEST, each from a fresh scene. The first cut of this ran all
/// four on one truck in sequence and the numbers were worthless: the impact
/// case inherited the spin-out's slide - 73 degrees of slip while it was
/// supposed to be driving straight - and by the fourth case the truck was not
/// moving at all, so a released look was measured over a parked lorry.
///
/// TWO ANGLES, not one, because the bullet says "the direction the truck
/// DRIVES" and that is not always the nose:
///
///   off-nose    camera forward against the hull's forward. This is what the
///               camera is built to hold: `ChaseCamera` settles behind
///               `target.eulerAngles.y` with `yawDamp` of lag.
///   off-travel  camera forward against the velocity vector. In reverse this
///               is 180 degrees BY DESIGN - the driver looks over the bonnet
///               while the truck backs up - so it is recorded and not
///               asserted. Turning the camera round in reverse is a decision,
///               not a fault to fix quietly.
///
/// Velocity is read the way `ChaseCamera.cs:380` reads it: the core when a
/// core is answering, the kinematic body only as its fallback. In the editor
/// `BlwpCore.Available` is false - the core is a stub outside a WebGL build -
/// so this measures the renderer's geometry with the PhysX velocity standing
/// in for the core's. The geometry does not branch on where the vector came
/// from; nothing here writes truck, army or core state.
