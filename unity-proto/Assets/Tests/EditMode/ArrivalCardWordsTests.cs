/// THE ARRIVAL CARD'S WORDS, from Daniel's 13:05 shot (daniel-screens/delivered-text-clip-1305.jpg).
///
/// Three faults in one card, all of them in the strings rather than in the box:
///
/// 1. "DELIVERED  7.225 sat to the" - the rest of the headline was past the screen edge. The card fitted its font
///    to "BLOCK MINED WITHOUT YOU" and then drew a line half again as long. The fix is structural: the four lines
///    are built once, the fit is measured on them, and the same strings are drawn. That is what these tests read.
/// 2. "those fees go to the miners   the score is what the run pays you" - the em dash between the halves drew as
///    nothing. WebGL has no OS fonts to fall back on, so a glyph the embedded font lacks is simply absent.
/// 3. "load 0,83" - the decimals came out under the browser's culture. The build is English (CLAUDE.md).
///
/// The width itself is not asserted here: GUIStyle.CalcSize is legal only inside OnGUI (GlyphProbeTests says so),
/// so it is measured on the live page instead. What is checked here is that every line the card draws is a line
/// the card can draw at all.
