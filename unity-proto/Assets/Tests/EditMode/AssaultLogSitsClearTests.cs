/// <summary>
/// THE ASSAULT LOG SITS ON THE LEFT HUD STACK, AND THE BANNER STAYS OFF THE PRICE.
///
/// Two rulings. 2026-09-20 16:26 gave the log its rules - "a small desktop-only debug log under the HUD, clock
/// times ... Not on phone. Do not overlap the $ price" - and it was first drawn in the headline gap under the
/// block clock, which cleared the price and then sat CENTRED OVER THE ROAD, photographed on Daily 0.0.1835.
/// The second ruling settled where it goes: "Left column. Under SIM, left-aligned, small font, same six assault
/// lines, colour still by side. Not the right column - that edge already carries WANTED and the touch buttons,
/// and the road has to stay clear."
///
/// So this pins the LEFT column now, and that is a change of what is asserted, not a loosening: the old
/// position was itself the fault. The BANNER is unchanged and still checked against the headline stack - it is
/// the loud thing, it belongs in front of the player, and only the log went to the edge.
///
/// Checked at the size the screenshots are taken at and at two others, because a box that clears the road at
/// 1280x800 and lands on it at 844x390 is the same bug photographed later.
