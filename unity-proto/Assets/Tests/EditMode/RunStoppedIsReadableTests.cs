/// MEASURED on one build with a VOID forced by starving a tab until its round closed under it:
///   daniel-screens/ring-11.png  the ROAD, run VOID, lobby still down - "RUN STOPPED - the node refuses this
///                               run's inputs at tick 7957: error the round" plainly on screen.
///   daniel-screens/ring-28.png  the BAY, same build, same VOID - nothing on screen at all.
///
/// Two faults, both on the existing DrawRunStopped path:
///   1. `OnGUI` returned early on the loading branch - `if (loading) { DrawWasted(); return; }` - so in the bay
///      the row was never DRAWN. It was not covered, which is what the geometry first suggested; the call simply
///      never happened. A truck still choosing cargo when the block closes is the path that ends VOID, so the bay
///      is where the line matters most.
///   2. The box was `font * 2.8`. At 1280x800 that is 67 px and the copy wraps to three lines, about 83 px, so it
///      cut at "error the round" and lost "is closed" - the half that answers why.
///
/// These pin the geometry at the size the screenshots were taken at, so neither can go back quietly.
