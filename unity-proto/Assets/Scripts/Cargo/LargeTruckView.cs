/// THE LARGER TRUCK, DRAWN (kanban #369, the first in-game item; Daniel 2026-10-15: "a larger truck for 500 satoshis. It can load
/// 30% more packages and is slightly faster").
///
/// The core decides the truck: a run whose entry plays with the item is started with its unlock and drives a bed of 255590
/// (3.9 m, 1.3 x the standard 196608) - and its own drive acceleration, which reaches the screen by itself, since the view
/// follows the core's pose. What is left to draw is the length. Read off the core every frame
/// (<see cref="Blwp.BlwpCore.TruckBedMeters"/>), never chosen here:
///
///   - THE BAY takes the core's bed: the same front (behind the cab), the bed 0.9 m longer towards the tail, so 30 % more room
///     and the crates packed over all of it;
///   - THE BODY stretches only its bed: every vertex between the bed's front and its tail (the bay's own span, 3.0 m) is
///     spread over 3.9 m, everything behind it moves back the 0.9 m - the cab is untouched and the truck is 0.9 m longer.
///     The wheels left the body when it was dressed (Bootstrap.NormaliseTruckModel), so they are not stretched.
///
/// Back to the standard truck, every mesh is its original again. A body swapped in later (the model streaming in) is measured
/// and stretched afresh.
