/// The scene is assembled in one pass at boot, and at that moment the terrain
/// is still the flat stand-in it builds from before the first fee histogram
/// lands - 2.7 m up. The truck was parked against that, its start mark taken
/// from where it stood, and seconds later the real mempool arrived and raised
/// the ground under it to 9 m. From then on the truck was five metres inside
/// the hill: it fell through the collider, sank, and every respawn put it back
/// under the map - which is why it appeared to be parked beneath its own
/// loading dock while the post office stood correctly on top of it.
///
/// So the mark is not a position taken once. It is a question asked of the
/// building, re-asked whenever MempoolTerrain says the ground has been rebuilt,
/// which is the same watch the roads and the two megastructures keep.
