    /// THEATRE, AND ONLY THEATRE. The core has no aircraft and no bomb. It
    /// consumes a liquidation, picks a point near the front, and digs the hole
    /// in that same tick - `sim.js` step 0. Nothing here is asked, nothing here
    /// is remembered, and nothing here can change where the crater is or how
    /// deep it goes. Take this component out and the simulation is identical;
    /// only the picture is poorer.
    ///
    /// Which is also why the timing runs the other way round from what it looks
    /// like. The hole exists the instant the strike arms; the bomb is drawn
    /// falling INTO a crater that is already there, and `MempoolTerrain` holds
    /// the ground shut for `craterRevealDelay` seconds so the two line up. The
    /// numbers here and that delay are one setting in two places:
    ///
    ///   104 m of run-in at 26 m/s                      ->  4.00 s in sight
    ///   release 61 m short, 22 m up, drawn at 8 m/s^2   ->  2.35 s of fall
    ///                                                        6.35 s, call it 6.4
    ///
    /// The fall is deliberately slow. At a real 30 m/s^2 from 22 m it was over
    /// in 1.21 s - two frames at the rate a headless browser renders, and not
    /// long enough for a player to see what left the aircraft either. A retarded
    /// fall is also what a free-fall nuclear weapon actually does, so that the
    /// aircraft dropping it can get away.
    ///
    /// The altitude came down from 70 m to 22 and the speed from 60 m/s to 26,
    /// both measured rather than guessed: `WorldToScreenPoint` against the live
    /// chase camera put the first cut 57 degrees off the camera axis for the
    /// whole of its approach, in a frame 90 degrees wide, and 33 degrees up in
    /// a frame that only looks 20 degrees above the horizon. A bomber the
    /// player never sees is not theatre. At these numbers it is in shot from
    /// about 2.9 s to 8.6 s - the release and the impact both inside that.
    ///
    /// The altitude came down twice, from 70 m to 45 to 22, each time because
    /// the photographs showed the same thing: the chase camera sits low and
    /// pitched down, so anything much above fifteen degrees of elevation spends
    /// the whole run above the top of the frame. A bomber the player never sees
    /// is not theatre.
