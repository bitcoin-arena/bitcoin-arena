# THE DAILY'S KEEPER (Daniel 2026-09-15, 12:54: always one free round and one paying 2-of-2 open).
#
# The seats are reached through two Cloudflare quick tunnels, and a quick tunnel gets a new public
# name every time it restarts; the seats bond under those names, and daily.json - deployed beside
# the page - names them. So a tunnel restart, a reboot or a launcher restart leaves the deployed
# lobby pointing at silence until the launcher runs under the new names and the page is deployed
# again. This does that, every 30 s:
#   1. read each tunnel's current name from its own unit's journal (this invocation only);
#   2. if they differ from what the seats run under, write them to seats.env and restart the seats;
#   3. once daily.json names exactly those two and both answer /rounds through them, deploy the kept
#      page with it through deploy-core.sh - which checks every seat again and refuses silence -
#      when daily.json differs from the one last deployed from here.
# Durable public names (an account tunnel) stay parked; this covers the gap.
#
# ITS DEPLOYS NEED CLOUDFLARE AUTH THAT NEEDS NO BROWSER (Daniel 2026-09-15: a Pages-only API token,
# for the keeper alone). Measured before: wrangler's OAuth login lapsed - "Not logged in ... the
# environment is non-interactive" - and a tunnel restart then left the Daily naming dead seats with
# nothing able to deploy. The unit reads $BLWP_2OF2_DIR/cloudflare.env, owned by this user, mode 600:
#   CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=<token>
#   CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=<the account that owns the btc-logistics-core Pages project>
# The token, created at dash.cloudflare.com -> My Profile -> API Tokens -> Create Custom Token:
#   Permissions:        Account | Cloudflare Pages | Edit          (nothing else)
#   Account Resources:  Include | <that one account>
#   Client IP filter / TTL: optional
# With CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID set, wrangler pages deploy needs no user or membership scope.
# THE FILE IS READ ON EVERY PASS, so a token dropped in is used within 30 s with no restart - and
# only from a file this user owns with mode 600. WITHOUT IT THE KEEPER DOES NOT DEPLOY (Daniel
# 2026-09-15): wrangler's browser login lapses and cannot be renewed unattended - measured, it
# failed every 30 s - so the keeper says once why it holds and keeps the seats on the tunnels'
# names. Nothing here prints the token.
