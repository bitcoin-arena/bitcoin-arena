// DO TWO TABS THAT PRESS PLAY A LITTLE APART LAND IN THE SAME ROUND? (Daniel 2026-09-17 19:15, the two-tab gate.)
//
// Every ghost number on this letter was measured with BOTH seats pinned to one round id: the probe reads the lobby
// once and hands the same round to the driver and the watcher. A player does not do that. Daniel opens one tab, presses
// PLAY, then opens the second and presses PLAY - seconds or a minute later - and each tab picks a round out of its own
// lobby listing. If the first tab's round stops being joinable in between, the second tab joins the NEXT one, the two
// are in different rounds, and neither is ever shown the other: no ghost, no label, no rim marker, and nothing in the
// draw path is wrong.
//
// So this reads the lobby the page reads - `fetchLobby`, the same rows, the same `joinable` rule - and writes down how
// long a free round stays joinable and how long the gap is before the next one. It seats nobody and drives nothing.
