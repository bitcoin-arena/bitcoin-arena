// DOES A WATCHER WHOSE OWN RUN HAS FINISHED STILL GET PICTURES? (Daniel 2026-09-18 20:00, SPECTATE.)
//
// `finish()` no longer closes the socket, so the line to the node stays up after a run ends - but an open socket is
// not proof that anything still comes down it. A player who presses SPECTATE after their own run wants the other
// trucks to keep moving, and those arrive over that line. This drives two seats: one keeps driving, the other calls
// `finish()` mid-round and then only watches. Counted: pictures before the finish, pictures after it, the round they
// name, and how long the gap is - so "the node stopped pushing" is a number rather than a fear.
//
// Measured before this tool existed, for one entry at one moment: one signer held 8986 ticks of that run and the
// other held 0. A watcher is pictured by the signer it is subscribed to, so a tab on the empty signer can only be
// shown an old tick or nothing at all - which is "Truck 1 cannot see Truck 2", and an age of 6736 ms.
//
// So, for two tabs in one round, this records at the same wall clock:
//   - the signer each tab is subscribed to
//   - the tick each signer holds for the driver's entry (the `x-ticks` header of its own /transcript)
//   - the tick of the picture the watcher was just shown, and the tick the driver has published
// and reports the age of a picture against both, plus whether the empty signer ever catches up.
