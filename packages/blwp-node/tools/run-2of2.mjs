/**
 * THE DAILY'S 2-OF-2 (M3.3-34): two blwp-nodes on one machine, threshold 2,
 * bonded, and a free round always joinable in the lobby.
 *
 *   RT=/mnt/bitcoin/blwp-2of2/btc RPCPORT=30401 \
 *   BLWP_WSS_18080=wss://beelink.tail1723e2.ts.net/blwp-a \
 *   BLWP_WSS_18081=wss://beelink.tail1723e2.ts.net/blwp-b \
 *   node tools/run-2of2.mjs
 *
 * Signer node A :18080 and signer node B :18081 (BLWP_PORT_A / BLWP_PORT_B) on the tailnet
 * address (BLWP_BIND). NEVER 8080: signal-cli holds it on this host, so the
 * launcher refuses it by name instead of meeting it as a bind error. Reachable
 * on Tailscale, not LAN (Daniel 2026-09-08). The Daily page is https, so a
 * browser reaches the signer nodes through the tailnet's https funnel - /blwp-a and
 * /blwp-b proxied to these two ports - and BLWP_WSS_<port> names that public
 * address; the lobby link is built from it (round-2of2.mjs `publicFor`).
 *
 * THE ROUNDS ARE THE OPENER'S (round-2of2.mjs `keepOpen`): whenever no round
 * has a minute of entry left, the next free round is opened on the same two
 * signer nodes - published on the chain and joined under its own beacon block - so
 * the lobby never empties when an entry closes. That chain is the regtest
 * bitcoind named by RT and RPCPORT, which the opener mines: testnet4 cannot be
 * mined on demand, and every round waits on its beacon block. It is a free
 * test round's chain, not a claim about Bitcoin. The signer nodes' stores stay in
 * BLWP_2OF2_DIR, so each signer node keeps its key across restarts. The committee's
 * Lightning endpoint stays opt-in (the four BLWP_LND* settings, read by
 * standUpRound); unset, the signer nodes hold no stakes.
