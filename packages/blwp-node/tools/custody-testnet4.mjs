// A TESTNET4 HOLD THAT SETTLES ON A PREIMAGE THE SIGNER NODES REBUILD (§23.4, Daniel 2026-09-21).
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACED, AND WHY. The first version of this tool held and settled three real invoices on the
// live pair and proved the hold path end to end - ACCEPTED -> HELD -> SETTLED/CANCELLED, with the msat and
// the channel totals recorded in TASKBOOK on 2026-09-20. But it handed the 32 bytes in:
//
//     const custody = new Custody(round, { port, preimageFor: (id, e) => preimageOf(e.pubkey[31]) });
//
// `preimageOf` fabricated them - 0xc0, the run's nonce, the player's number - so the settle proved lnd works
// and proved nothing about custody. One endpoint knew the secret and spent it. That is the single-node
// custody §23.4 exists to end, and both injection sites (the Custody above and the restart `maker`) are gone:
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE CAN PUT A FABRICATED PREIMAGE ON THE SETTLE PATH ANY MORE.
//
// WHAT IT DOES INSTEAD. Two real signer nodes, each with its own store and its own key, serving on loopback:
//   - the round names THEIR pubkeys as its settlement seats, not placeholders;
//   - the stake's preimage is dealt as a handout, so each seat holds one share and the entry publishes them;
//   - node A issues the hold on the live testnet4 lnd, B pays it from the other end of the real channel;
//   - the round closes with no first mark, which is FORFEIT (§15's walk-away), so the hold must SETTLE;
//   - and A settles it with bytes it does not have: `fromTheCommittee` (server.js:309) opens A's own share,
//     asks B over `GET /share?round=..&entry=..`, and reconstructs P. Fewer than the threshold and there is
//     no preimage at all, and the hold would sit in flight until it expired back to the player.
//
// TWO OF TWO IS NOT FIVE OF SEVEN, AND THIS DOES NOT PRETEND IT IS. `receiptsNeeded` (protocol/threshold.js)
// knows exactly two committee shapes - 2 slots need 2 shares, 7 slots need 5 - and throws for anything else.
// This pair is a 2-of-2: BOTH seats must answer, so it demonstrates that a settle is built from shares held
// by separate nodes over a real door. It does not demonstrate surviving the loss of a seat, which is what
// five of seven buys. The seven-seat shape is exercised in process by `five-of-seven.test.js`.
//
// THE CENSUS IS ASSUMED OUT LOUD. There is no live testnet4 census here, so each node is told who the round's
// seats are with `round.recordSignerNodes` - the same one-line assumption the in-process suites make, said
// rather than smuggled. Nothing else about assignment is faked.
//
//   node packages/blwp-node/tools/custody-testnet4.mjs            one real hold on the live pair
//   node packages/blwp-node/tools/custody-testnet4.mjs --dry      the same wiring against a fake port
//
// The dry run exists so the two-node reconstruction is proved before a sat is put at risk: it is the same
// code path with the Lightning port swapped, and it is how this tool was brought up without spending holds.

// that run" and A stopped at "1 of 2 shares: a stake nobody can open stays in flight". So the round is closed
