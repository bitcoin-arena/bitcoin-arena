// THE HOLD-INVOICE STATE MACHINE AGAINST THE LIVE TESTNET4 PAIR (M3, Daniel 2026-09-20).
//
// `custody-lnd.mjs` proves the same rules on an isolated regtest it spawns and MINES. This runs the same
// `Custody` - the same four operations, the same outcome mapping - against the two gateways that actually
// exist, and mines nothing, because nobody can mine testnet4.
//
//   A  /mnt/bitcoin/lnd-testnet4    0274e261...  rpc 11009   the custodian: it issues the hold
//   B  /mnt/bitcoin/lnd-testnet4-b  025f17c2...  rpc 11010   the player's wallet: it pays
//
// THE OUTCOME WORD COMES FROM THE CORE, never from this script and never from a browser. Each entry is handed
// to `custody.settleHeldInvoices` with the round's verdict, and `custody.js` decides what that word means:
//
//   DELIVERED  -> cancel   -> CANCELLED   the player delivered; the stake goes back
//   FORFEIT    -> settle   -> SETTLED     the preimage is released; the stake enters the pool
//   VOID       -> NOTHING  -> EXPIRED     no port call of any kind
//
// VOID IS AN ABSENCE AND THAT IS THE POINT. "A cancel is an ACT, and it needs five of seven; a refund that
// needed an act is one an operator could withhold." What refunds a void player is Bitcoin's timelock, not our
// goodwill - measured on regtest: an invoice expiry stops applying the moment an HTLC is ACCEPTED, and the
// HTLC failed back at height 332 of an expiry at 345. On testnet4 that wait is real hours, so this tool
// proves the absence and RECORDS the expiry height against the tip; the refund itself is a later pass.
//
// AND THEN IT CLEANS UP, WHICH IS NOT THE PROTOCOL PATH AND SAYS SO. A paid hold left sitting until its CLTV
// is a hold lnd will eventually force-close the channel to resolve - and that channel is the inbound the
// gateways were just proved to have. So after the VOID measurement is taken, the third hold is cancelled as
// HOUSEKEEPING, clearly labelled, after the numbers are in. Nothing about the VOID row is read from it.
//
// STILL SINGLE-NODE CUSTODY, NOT §23.5. One endpoint issues and settles; `preimageFor` is handed in rather
// than reconstructed from five of seven shares. FROST closes that gap. This does not, and does not pretend to.
