// POSTING A REAL BOND ON A REAL REGTEST, as one thing two tools can use.
//
// Lifted out of `census-regtest.mjs`, which has done this since letter 15 and
// is still the file that measures the census itself. What forced the move is
// letter 32: the committee seed is a block of THE CHAIN, and the census is
// derived from blocks too, so a tool that reads its beacon from bitcoind and
// its census from a fixture is a node reasoning about two different chains -
// and the roster's "is this the block my chain names" check can never pass
// there. One chain means the bonds live where the beacon does.
//
// It is not a wallet and not a bond policy: it funds a carrier, spends it with
// the advertisement body in the witness, and hands back the raw transaction.
// The construction question - a witness the mempool would also relay - is
// still the letter that posts a bond for real, and is named in census-regtest.
