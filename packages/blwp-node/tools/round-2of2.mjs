/**
 * ONE ROUND THE TWO DAEMONS AGREE ON, AND THE URL THAT OPENS IT.
 *
 *   node packages/blwp-node/tools/round-2of2.mjs
 *
 * The page can be SENT to a round now - `?round=` names an id and the client
 * refuses a contract that does not hash to it - and it names three other
 * things: who holds the round, where a chain is read, and where the bond
 * proof is asked for. The daemons publish the first. THEY PUBLISH NEITHER OF
 * THE OTHER TWO, and they should not: section 25.1 wants block headers "from
 * several independent sources", and a node serving the chain that proves its
 * own bond is one source wearing two hats. So the providers stand beside the
 * daemons, on their own ports, which is what an operator runs.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a lobby: it agrees one round between two daemons
 * that already exist and prints the address of it. Nothing here is in the
 * page, and the page still invents nothing - it is handed names and it checks
 * them.
 *
 * THE CHAIN IS A FIXTURE AND IS SAID SO. Bitcoin's real genesis header with
 * one block mined on top of it at trivial difficulty, carrying the bond. That
 * is enough for `Client.at` to do every check it makes - the anchor is
 * genesis and comes from the client, the header must link and be mined, the
 * bond must be proven into it by a merkle branch, and the advertisement must
 * be signed by the key the committee names - and it is not a claim about
 * Bitcoin. A round played on it is a local test round. Reading a real chain is
 * the operator's own bitcoind, and no live node is touched from here.

 * that never answered, which is the worst kind of wall: it fails where the

 *
 * So the same build is served here, over the same scheme as the daemons. The
 * page is byte for byte the deployed one; only where it is fetched from
 * changes. The daemons are still a different ORIGIN (a different port), which
 * is why their doors carry access-control-allow-origin.
 *
 * The content types matter: Unity's loader will not start a wasm module served
