// WHAT POST /entry TAKES, COUNTED - THE FEE AND THE STAKE.
//
// M3.3 item 20. `feeMatchesEntry` says an entry's fee must be exactly 2% of
// its stake: too little and the round collects less than the fee table will owe
// its nodes, too much and the excess is income no table allocates. It has ZERO
// CALLERS outside its own tests. Letter 15 made the PAGE write the right fee;
// this is the door that accepts them.
//
// AND THE FEE RULE ALONE DOES NOT CLOSE IT, which is why this file counts two
// matrices and not one. `feeMatchesEntry` is SELF-REFERENTIAL: it compares the
// entry's fee to the entry's OWN stake, and the entry names both. An entry
// claiming `stakeMsat: 0, feeMsat: 0` satisfies it perfectly - and
// `custody.hold` invoices `entry.stakeMsat`, so that player pays nothing, while
// `winnings` pays `amountMsat - stake`, so a zero stake is paid the whole table
// row out of other players' money. A door enforcing only the fee would look
// checked and still pass a free seat.
//
// This file was the measurement before the door was tightened - six of six
// wrong fees taken, four of four self-named stakes taken - and it is the pin
// after it. Both checks are against the ROUND CONTRACT and never against the
// entry's own story, which is what makes them checks at all.
