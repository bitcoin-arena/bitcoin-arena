// (every claimed lock stored, P opening its point, the signature under claim_pk

//
// MEASURED BEFORE (W5b, TASKBOOK): nothing claimed a loser's lock - its forfeit
// was 409, the lock stayed held and went back to the loser at its expiry.

 * `REAL_FEES` is 1000 msat base, measured on fedimintd 0.12.0, and §22A forbids exactly that: a BLWP
 * federation runs with `disable_base_fees`. The node enforces it at the entry door, so a round can no longer
 * be OPENED against such a federation - that is what refused 43 entries across five suites. The arithmetic is
 * still worth testing, so the rule arrives here instead: after every entry, before the close.
 *
 * It is called by the tests that are ABOUT the real rule, never blanket-applied - a test that chooses its own
 * federation (the fee-lock claim test runs a zero-fee one, because its 98000/2000 arithmetic is what a legal
 * federation pays) must keep the rule it chose.
