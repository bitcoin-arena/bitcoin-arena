// A SEAT VERIFIES THE PLAYER'S STAKE LOCK BEFORE THE STAKE IS COMMITTED (§23.1 step 5).
//
// Custody is the stake lock (FEDERATION.md, Daniel 2026-09-11): the player's
// client locks the net stake in the round's federation as a stock LNv2
// OutgoingContract - payment_image Point(stake_point), claim_pk the round's
// key, refund_pk the player, expiration >= height + 144. "STAKE_COMMITTED is
// recorded once >=5 settlement nodes have VERIFIED the locks: the contract id
// at stake_lock_outpoint equals the hash of a contract whose ..." (§23.1 step
// 5). The federation is reached through a port, as Lightning is.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE (TASKBOOK, acffd59): a seat of a federation round, a lock
// stored at the entry's outpoint - POST /lock 404, /stake 409 for want of
// Lightning, the federation asked 0 times, the stake never seen.
