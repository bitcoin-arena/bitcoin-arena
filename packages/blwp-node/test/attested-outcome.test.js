// A ROUND WHOSE RESULT IS NOT A REPLAY, ON TWO SIGNER NODES AND THE FAKE FEDERATION (kanban #206 slice 1, §0A.7a; Daniel
// 2026-10-07): an attested market's round - entries that back an outcome (`pick`) and play no run, the attestors' outcome
// in through POST /outcome, the pari-mutuel table out of GET /outcome, built by the seats from the picks and the outcome
// with no game code. Nothing moves in this slice: the settlement of an attested round is held.
//   1. the round never reaches the replay code - no worker job, no close queue, no gather, no settlement;
//   2. an attestation one signature short, signed by a key the manifest does not name, made for another round, or with an
//      outcome out of range is refused by name at the seat;
//   3. two standing attestations of different outcomes are held as the proof, and the round settles on neither;
//   4. the table balances to the msat, losers' net stakes to the winners pro rata, fee and donation as #205.
