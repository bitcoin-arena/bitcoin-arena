// A SUSPENDED RESULT AND THE COMMITTEE'S RE-RUN (v4.6.2 §13A).
//
// "A valid objection suspends finality. The full committee re-runs the
// canonical transcript; the replay outcome is authoritative. Every node that
// signed the contradicted result is slashed (§5A.3). If the committee cannot
// reach 5-of-7 on the re-run, §13C applies."
//
// THE FIXTURE, measured before (TASKBOOK, 2f01ea1): seven signer nodes (the holder and
// six keys), five sign a result with the score rewritten, the holder's own
// replay contradicts it, an objection is filed inside an 800 ms window - and
// two windows later the run was still SUSPENDED, no share released, 0 re-run
// results, because the node had no re-run.
//
// Now the holder re-runs by itself when the objection holds, the other signer nodes'
// re-runs are counted, and 5 of 7 on one outcome replace SUSPENDED. Short of
// that by the end of the re-run window - one objection window from the filing -
// §13C decides (RULED 2026-09-24): VOID, or FORFEIT on proven equivocation.
