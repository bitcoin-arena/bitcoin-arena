// WINNINGS ARE ALWAYS SENT ON A FEDERATION ROUND (Daniel 2026-09-21: "winnings are always sent. There is no
// Collect"; ruled for FEDERATION 2026-09-23 - refund key the committee's, gateway the lowest live key, invoice taken
// only if its amount and its LUD-06 description hash stand).
//
// The winner names a Lightning address once, signed by the entry's session key, and nothing of the player's runs
// after that. Measured here on two signer nodes and the fake lock port (whose gateways, settle and send stand in for
// the federation's), with a fake LNURL address that issues real-format invoices it knows the preimages of:
//   PASS  the settlement pays the qualifier by ONE outgoing contract to the checked invoice - the lowest-key gateway,
//         the committee's refund key - the gateway is asked once, and each signer node keeps one payment row, PAID
//         with a preimage whose sha256 is the invoice's hash; settling again pays nothing more.
//   FAIL  a round with no qualifier - both runs under min_score, the address named anyway - builds no payout output
//         and asks the address for no invoice; both stake locks are left to expire back.
//   REFUSE an invoice whose amount, or whose description hash, is not what the check requires: no settlement is built.
//   EXPIRY the lowest-key gateway is live when the plan is made and never pays: past its expiration the contract returns
//         to the committee's refund key and is re-sent, through the next live gateway, to a fresh invoice - paid once.
