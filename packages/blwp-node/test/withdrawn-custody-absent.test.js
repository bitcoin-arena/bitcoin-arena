// A ROUND UNDER THE WITHDRAWN CUSTODY IS NO ROUND HERE, PAST ROUNDS INCLUDED (RULED, Daniel 2026-09-22 22:59).
//
// §23.6: "a record from before this ruling that carries the old value is not a round of this network and
// is neither decoded, replayed, settled, listed nor counted; a node that holds such a record treats it as
// it treats bytes that do not parse." Two doors to that: a byte-0 contract posted to `/round` is refused
// as bytes that do not parse - not a custody-specific 409 - and nothing of it is stored; and a store that
// already holds byte-0 rows, from before the ruling, answers them as absent after a restart, while the
// bytes stay where they are (absent, not deleted).
