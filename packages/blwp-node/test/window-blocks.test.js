// THE WINDOW IS BLOCKS, BOTH ENDS (§13A; RULED Daniel 2026-09-24) - a measurement of the ruling, locked as a test before
// any code follows it. No src is changed by this file.
//
// THE RULING, as `ruledWindow` below states it:
//   - A window opens at the timestamp of the block where its opening event sits (the objection's filing; for the
//     re-run's own window, the block where the agreed re-run first sits at threshold).
//   - It ends at the first LATER block whose timestamp is >= open + objection_window_ms. Both ends are chain facts;
//     no wall-clock receive time is an input on either end.
//   - An event is INSIDE only if its own block timestamp is strictly before the end block's; a filing in the end block
//     or any later block is OUTSIDE.
//   - A node that has not yet got the end block decides nothing - no FINAL, VOID, slash or claim. Tip lag is a wait.
//   - Once two holders have the same blocks through the end block, they name the same outcome.
//
// THE MEASURED SPLIT it is aimed at, on two holder daemons: node A is the fixture's holder, node B a second daemon on a
// byte copy of A's store (VACUUM INTO) - the same holder, its own clock and arrivals. The objection reaches A at t and B
// at t + 1500; W = 3000; the holder's re-run and three others arrive inside both local windows, the fifth agreeing re-run
// at t + 3500. On the committed local-clock finality (resultFinality at daa0bc28) A answers VOID and B
// PROVISIONALLY_FINAL at t + 5000 - measured here, and asserted as TODAY'S ANSWER, which the code that follows the ruling
// turns over.
//
// THE CHAIN is the fixtures' block clock (block-clock.js): one block per second, a block's timestamp its median time
// past. EACH FILING IS ASSIGNED ONE BLOCK - the first block at or after the filing's first sighting at either holder -
// because a filing is one artifact on one chain, whichever holder saw it first.
