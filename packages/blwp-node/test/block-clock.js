// A CHAIN THAT KEEPS TIME WITH THE TEST (§13A, RULED Daniel 2026-09-24: every objection window is blocks at both ends,
// read from the node's own chain view, and every posting, objection and re-run names the block it sits in). The fixtures'
// signer nodes read no bitcoind, so they are handed this: one mined header per `spacingS` seconds of the wall clock, each
// carrying the time five blocks ahead of its own, so the median time past of the block for second s is s. A view is the
// chain AS OF a moment - never a block after it - so a node's tip is the block of that moment: `chainView()` reads the
// real clock (live daemons), `viewAt(ms)` a stubbed one.
//
// Set on a Round as `round.chainView` - never through `chainFor`, which would also make the verifier check the fixtures'
// beacon against this chain.
