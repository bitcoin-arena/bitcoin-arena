// A CHAIN THAT KEEPS TIME WITH THE TEST (RULED Daniel 2026-09-24: every finality window counts from a block instant -
// the median time past of the first block at or after the moment - read from the node's own chain view, failing closed
// without one). The fixtures' signer nodes read no bitcoind, so they are handed this: one mined header per second of the
// wall clock, each carrying the second five ahead of its own, so the median time past of the block for second s is s.
// A moment a thus has the instant ceil(a / 1000) * 1000 at every signer node that reads the one chain - which is the
// point: two nodes that saw the same thing at different moments inside one second place it at one instant. The chain is
// mined a minute ahead of the clock so a block at the round's confirmation depth (the fixtures ask for 1) is there.
//
// Set on a Round as `round.chainView` - never through `chainFor`, which would also make the verifier check the
// fixtures' beacon against this chain.
