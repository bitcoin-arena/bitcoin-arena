// A PAYING ROUND DOES NOT OPEN WITHOUT TWO INDEPENDENT GATEWAYS (§23.6, M3, Daniel 2026-09-20).
//
// The law: "deposits and withdrawals through any of at least two gateways ... No gateway holds a round's
// money or is needed by it", and §22 is explicit that a gateway may refuse a deposit but never keep one. A
// round opened against a single endpoint is one outage away from a player who has paid and cannot be paid
// back, and the operator must not profit from a technical failure.
//
// `gatewaysAreIndependent` existed and was proven against the live pair, but NOTHING CALLED IT - so a paying
// round would open with no gateways at all. This is the call site and its refusal.
//
// WHERE IT IS CALLED: `lightningPreflight` in `blwp-node/src/preflight.js`, which is the one gate
// `server.js` consults on the paying-round open path - `POST /round`, under
// `if (contract.stakeMsat > 0n && custody.reaches)`, BEFORE `round.open(contract)`, before any invoice and
// before the round is advertised as payable. The browser never decides this; it is asked on the node.
//
// THE LAST TEST HERE IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS: delete the call from `lightningPreflight` and it goes red. A
// green suite must not be able to hide an unused predicate, which is exactly what this letter found.
