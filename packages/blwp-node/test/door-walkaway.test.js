// §15 AT THE DOOR (ALL-BUT-MIN-1727, Daniel 2026-09-29 17:27): "A seated player whose stake was committed and who sent
// no first mark is FORFEIT, score 0, at the door, not left undecided until the close. Never ENTRY_VOID. Never a refund.
// A first mark after the start deadline is the same FORFEIT."
//
// Two in-process signer nodes of a lock round (first-mark-fixture), the door swept every 250 ms. The player joins and
// locks at both - the stake seen - and sends nothing. With no close sent, once the start window has passed (the stake
// seen + the 900-tick deadline + the 5 s grace), both signer nodes sign FORFEIT 0 over the empty transcript. The
// player's own first mark sent after that is refused FORFEIT at the door, kept as the evidence; nothing changes.
// MEASURED BEFORE (the same test, without the door sweep): both signer nodes still held no result 30 s after the stake.
