// WINNINGS-AUTO (RULED Daniel 2026-10-01) replaces THE POOL (RULED 2026-09-23: (ii), with (iii); never (i)). A qualifier who names no Lightning

// renormalised over them; with nobody addressed no stake lock is claimed. Split out of winnings-sent.test.js so each

//   A  five qualifiers (two paying ranks), the top one unaddressed: the addressed second rank is sent the whole pot.
//   B  the only qualifier unaddressed: no stake lock claimed, no invoice asked; the fee locks still settle.
