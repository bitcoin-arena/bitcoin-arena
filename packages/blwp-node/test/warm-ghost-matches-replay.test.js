// A LIVE GHOST IS THE POSE THE TRANSCRIPT REPLAYS TO (Daniel 2026-09-18 12:02: "Drawn pose must match the other
// client's truck").
//
// Measured on the Daily before this test existed: a watcher's pictures sat exactly on a cold replay of the same
// transcript for the first half of a run - p50 0.000 m over 576 pictures - and then walked away from it, p50 14.2 m
// over the second half, p90 80 m, max 115 m, first parting at tick 5285 by 0.561 m. The node's own `replay()` and a
// bare core stepped with the same words agreed with each other at every sampled tick, so the odd one out was the LIVE
// path: `RunInProgress`, which keeps a run warm and steps it forward in slices rather than replaying it from the
// join. The node's stored transcript carried 9000 ticks and no liquidation, load, sample or tape, so no market event
// explains it.
//
// This drives the same two paths with no daemon and no network: one transcript, a cold replay for the poses, and a
// warm run stepped in slices the size the live pusher uses. They must be the same pose at every tick.
