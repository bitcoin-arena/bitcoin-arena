// A LAUNCHED DAEMON OPENS A PAYING ROUND THE OPERATOR NAMED, AND SIGNER NODES ITS ENTRIES (M3.3-31).
//
// Measured before: `main.js` passed `serve` no `funded`, so the default refused
// every round and every entry with 402 - a daemon started the way an operator
// starts one held no stake at all, and a round for testnet sats could not
// exist outside a harness that passed `() => true`.
//
// The rule (Daniel's pick): a ROUND is funded when the operator named it and it
// asks a stake - an explicit launcher setting, off by default, so a stranger
// still cannot open 200 free rounds; an ENTRY is funded when it names a round
// this node already holds, that round asks a stake, and this node reaches
// Lightning to hold it. Not "the invoice is paid": the hold is issued after the
// entry is stored. Input batches stay gated on the stake being seen paid.
