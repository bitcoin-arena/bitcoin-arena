// W6 SPLIT OUT OF lock-settlement.test.js (2026-09-23) so each file runs inside the 180 s cap: the restart cases
// grew a send plan each when a paid winner came to name a Lightning address.
// W4: THE LOSER'S STAKE LOCK IS CLAIMED INTO THE ROUND'S ONE SETTLEMENT, AND THE
// WINNER IS PAID FROM IT (Daniel 2026-09-14 07:22: "a loser loses the stake. The
// lock is claimed into the pool. Winners are paid from that."; FEDERATION.md
// money flow step 5).
//
// Two signer nodes of a lock round with a claim key made between them; a winner who
// delivers and a loser who wrecks, each staked by a lock both signer nodes verified. The
// federation port is the fixture's, checking a settlement as the guardians do
// (every claimed lock stored, P opening its point, the signature under claim_pk
// over the txid, the payouts inside what the locks pay) with the guardians' real
// fee rule, measured on stock fedimintd 0.12.0 by stake-lock-step3.sh: 1000 msat
// per input and per output, 0 ppm.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE (W5b, TASKBOOK): nothing claimed a loser's lock - its forfeit
// was 409, the lock stayed held and went back to the loser at its expiry.
// HARNESS: lockRound and lockAndPlay as forfeit.test.js has them (file-local there).

/**
 * FEDIMINTD'S MEASURED DEFAULT, APPLIED AFTER THE ENTRIES ARE IN (2026-09-21).
 *
 * `REAL_FEES` is 1000 msat base, measured on fedimintd 0.12.0, and §22A forbids exactly that: a BLWP
 * federation runs with `disable_base_fees`. The node enforces it at the entry door, so a round can no longer
 * be OPENED against such a federation - that is what refused 43 entries across five suites. The arithmetic is
 * still worth testing, so the rule arrives here instead: after every entry, before the close.
 *
 * It is called by the tests that are ABOUT the real rule, never blanket-applied - a test that chooses its own
 * federation (the fee-lock claim test runs a zero-fee one, because its 98000/2000 arithmetic is what a legal
 * federation pays) must keep the rule it chose.
