// A NODE DOES NOT SIT A ROUND AGAINST A FEDERATION THAT CHARGES A BASE FEE (§22A, FEDERATION.md item 4).
//
// The spec's own words: "The 2% stays. Fedimint's own base fees are 0: the federation runs with
// `disable_base_fees`. Lightning `min_htlc` / routing is not a federation fee." And Daniel 2026-09-15 07:44
// says the same thing as a ruling.
//
// WHY IT MATTERS ON THE NODE AND NOT ONLY IN THE PAGE. A base fee comes out of EVERY input and output of the
// round's locks - the players' own pool - so it is not a cost of playing, it is a deduction from a stake
// somebody has already committed, for nothing the round asked for. The 2% node fee is inclusive and is paid
// to the round's sitting seats for work they did; a base fee is money the operator did not earn. The client
// already refuses to lock against such a federation (`page-lock.js`); until now nothing on the node did, so a
// signer node would have taken entries into a round whose stakes were being shaved on the way in and out.
//
// THE LAST TEST IS THE ONE THAT MATTERS: delete the call from `server.js` and it goes red. A green suite must
// not be able to hide a guard nobody calls - the fault this project found once already with
// `gatewaysAreIndependent`.
