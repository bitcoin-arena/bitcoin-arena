// THE DOOR THAT PAYS A QUALIFIER (§24A.2).
//
// "A payout contract to the player's key; the client withdraws it over Lightning through any listed
// gateway." On THRESHOLD_LN the pool IS the committee's Lightning balance, so the withdrawal is an ordinary
// payment - and the only thing standing between a public entry id and the operator's money is the
// signature. Measured on the Daily before this door existed: a settled round left 98000 msat owed to the
// winner with nothing able to carry it, and the 98 sat sat in the committee's own channel.
