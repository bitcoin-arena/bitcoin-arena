// THE PICTURE HAS TO KEEP UP WITH THE TRUCK THAT IS DRIVING.
//
// Letter 28 got a ghost drawn. Daniel, 09:44: two tabs see the other truck at
// spawn and then it does not follow - frames land rarely, it stutters, it is
// not realtime. Measured before this file existed, one frame of one watcher:
//
//     tick     5    11.8 ms
//     tick  1085    94.6 ms      the whole 100 ms budget, eighteen seconds in
//     tick  3599   568.9 ms      five batches behind, per watcher
//
// A driver publishes every 100 ms (`BatchEvery` is 6 ticks at 60 Hz), so the
// picture kept up for about eighteen seconds and then fell behind for good.
// Every frame replayed the run from tick zero.
//
// A GHOST IS STILL A PICTURE (0.10). Nothing here is an input to anybody's
// simulation, nothing is computed in a browser, and the pose still comes off
// the node replaying the transcript it stored. What changed is that the ticks
// already stepped are not stepped again.
