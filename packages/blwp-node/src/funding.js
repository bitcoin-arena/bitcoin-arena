// WHAT A LAUNCHED DAEMON COUNTS AS FUNDED (M3.3-31).
//
// `serve` refuses a round or an entry nobody funded - the disk is spent only on
// stakes that exist (IMPLEMENTATION.md), and a default of yes is how a stranger
// opened 200 free rounds. But `main.js` gave `serve` no answer at all, so a
// launched daemon refused EVERY round and every entry with 402 and held no
// stake: a round for sats existed only where a harness passed `() => true`.
//
// The rule (Daniel's pick):
//   a ROUND is funded when the operator NAMED it and it asks a stake - named in
//     BLWP_FUNDED_ROUNDS (ids, comma or space) or BLWP_FUNDED_ROUNDS_FILE (one
//     id per line, read on every ask, so a round can be named without a
//     restart). Neither set, none named. A free round is not funded here.
//   an ENTRY is funded when it names a round this node already holds, that
//     round asks a stake, and this node can hold it: Lightning for a hold
//     invoice, and - for a round naming a federation, whose stake is a lock
//     the signer node verifies there (§23.1 step 5, W1b) - the federation.
// NOT "the invoice is paid": the hold is issued after the entry is stored. The
// transcript waits for the money anyway - input batches are refused until the
// stake is seen paid.
