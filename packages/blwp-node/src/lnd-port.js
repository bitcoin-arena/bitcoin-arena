// A READ-ONLY WINDOW ONTO A REAL LIGHTNING NODE: IT DECODES AN INVOICE, AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// This file used to be the port a signer node's custody drove - issue a hold invoice on the hash an
// entry named, look it up, settle it with a preimage, cancel it - and its own header said what that was:
// "SINGLE-NODE CUSTODY, NOT §23.5. One `lncli`, one macaroon, one operator who could run every one of
// these commands by hand." That custody is THRESHOLD_LN, and it does not exist (§23.6, RULED 2026-09-22
// 22:59): the custody field has one value, FEDERATION. Issuing, looking up, settling, cancelling and
// paying are gone with it, and so is the table mapping lnd's invoice states onto 23.2's.
//
// WHAT IS LEFT, AND NEITHER IS CUSTODY:
//
//   decode    `/federation-invoice` must say which hash and amount the federation's LNv2 invoice carries
//             before a player commits to them, read off the invoice rather than the federation's word.
//             `decodepayreq` is local and read-only.
//   invoice   an ORDINARY invoice (`addinvoice`, no hold), which the donation recipients a launcher binds
//             mint to be paid a §22A donation. No stake is in it; money arrives and stays. This was cut with
//             the rest at first and restored: the caller is a tool, not `src/`, and only `src/` was checked.
