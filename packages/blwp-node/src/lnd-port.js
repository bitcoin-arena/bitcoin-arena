// THE PORT THAT REACHES A REAL LIGHTNING NODE.
//
// `custody.js` decides what should happen to a stake and this is the transport
// that makes it happen, injected the same way `sign`, the curve and `chainFor`
// are. Everything the rules say is measured against a fake port with no node
// running; this file exists so that the same rules can be run against
// `lnd v0.21.3-beta` and the answer compared.
//
// FOUR OPERATIONS, AND THEY ARE NOT SYMMETRIC:
//
//   createHeld   `addholdinvoice <hash> --amt_msat` - the hash comes from the
//                player's own Entry Contract, so this node commits money to a
//                preimage it may not have
//   look         `lookupinvoice <hash>` - the only party that knows what
//                actually happened to an invoice is the node holding it
//   settle       `settleinvoice <preimage>` - NOT the hash. Releasing the
//                preimage IS the settlement, which is why 23.4 wants five of
//                seven shares before it can be done
//   cancel       `cancelinvoice <hash>` - the only act that returns money
//
// LND'S STATES ARE NOT 23.2'S, so they are mapped here and nowhere else. An
// OPEN invoice and an ACCEPTED one are both HELD as far as the protocol is
// concerned: money is in flight and in nobody's balance either way, and the
// difference between them is whether the player has paid yet. lnd has no
// EXPIRED for a hold - an invoice that runs out is CANCELED - so the state a
// stake reaches by nobody acting reads back as CANCELLED, and this node's own
// row is the only place the difference is recorded.
//
// SINGLE-NODE CUSTODY, NOT §23.5. One `lncli`, one macaroon, one operator who
// could run every one of these commands by hand. FROST is what closes that.

      // on the one custody a player actually pays. The number is not chosen here - it is the one the
