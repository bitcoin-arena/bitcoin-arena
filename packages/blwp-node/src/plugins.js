// only if its manifest is a game (protocol/src/manifest.js manifestStands: its developer's signature, its parent rule)
// and every core the node installed for it is one the manifest lists, with configs the manifest lists. A round is then
// played only on a game this node hosts, on a core it installed for that game, under a config it installed, and only if
// the round fits the manifest (run length, rank curve, min_score). Nothing here imports a game: `replay.js` drives the
// adapter it is handed (start, eventsOf, step, stateHash, result, picture, runTicksFits).
