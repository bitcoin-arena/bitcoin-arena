// AN OBJECTION, CHECKED ON ITS OWN EVIDENCE (§13A, kanban #24, RULED Daniel 2026-10-04: "An objection must carry the
// transcript and the receipts").
//
// "It is valid iff every checkpoint carries genuine receipts, the chain is consistent, and deterministic replay under
// the round's sim_wasm_hash produces claimed_result != signed_result. Anyone can check this; there is no judgement
// involved, only replay."
//
// Until this, POST /objection took no body and an objection held only where the seat's OWN replay already disagreed -
// so two seats that signed a lie together could not be overturned by the player holding the true run and its receipts.
// This is the one check a seat runs on the bundle at its door, and the same function a stranger runs from the command
// line (tools/check-objection.mjs): nothing here reads a store, a clock or a peer. What it is handed - the round's
// contract, committee, entry and signed run, the core and the beacon - is public; the replay is the core's.
//
// THE REFUSALS, IN THIS ORDER, EACH NAMED (the agreement): the signature; the round, entry and result named; the
// transcript's hash; the checkpoint chain; that the transcript belongs to the entry; that every checkpoint has a receipt
// signed by a committee member; the replay under the round's own core gives the claimed result, and it differs from the
// signed one.
