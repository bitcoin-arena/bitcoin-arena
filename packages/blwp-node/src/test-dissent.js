//   - this seat's replay counts as differing from the agreed run, so an objection to it holds here (finality.js);
//   - this seat's re-run is signed with the score one higher - a different run (verify.js rerun).
// Nothing else changes, for that entry or any other. Unset - the default on every seat - this module answers false.
