// A SIGNER NODE VERIFIES THE PLAYER'S STAKE LOCK (v4.6.2 §23.1 step 5).
//
// "STAKE_COMMITTED is recorded once >=5 settlement nodes have VERIFIED the
// locks: the contract id at stake_lock_outpoint (and the fee lock's) equals
// the hash of a contract whose payment_image is the entry's stake_point,
// whose amount is the entry's net stake, whose claim_pk is the attested key,
// whose refund_pk is player_pubkey, and whose expiration is >= lock_height
// + stake_expiry_blocks", lock_height no more than 12 blocks below the height the
// seat verifies at. Seeing the lock is not enough: the player built it. (RULED
// 2026-09-24, option (a): lock_height is the federation-held expiration less 144 -
// the one checked below against blockCount + blocksLeft - and blockCount is the
// verify height handed to lockMatchesEntry.)
//
// This is one signer node's half. The player hands the signer node the contract it locked;
// the signer node asks the federation what it holds at the entry's outpoint (the
// stored contract id and the blocks left to its expiry), hashes the handed
// contract with the stock client's own rule, and requires the two to be one
// contract; then protocol stake-lock.js `lockMatchesEntry` checks every field
// against the entry. Only then is the stake seen - the same record the play
// gate reads, so a verified lock and a held HTLC open play the same way.
//
// THE FEDERATION IS A PORT, as Lightning is: `status(outpoint)` answers
// `{ blockCount, stored: { contractId, blocksLeft } | null }` and
// `contractId(fields)` the stock hash (blwp-stake-lock, over the Rust client
// crates). The fee lock is not checked here: its claim hash and the §22A node
// slots wait on a ruling (PRIORITIES).

 * A FEDERATION THAT CHARGES A BASE FEE TAKES MONEY THE OPERATOR DID NOT EARN.
 *
 * FEDERATION.md item 4, and Daniel 2026-09-15 07:44: "Fedimint base fee is 0 - run the federation with
 * `disable_base_fees`." §22A says it in the spec's own words: "The 2% stays. Fedimint's own base fees are 0:
 * the federation runs with `disable_base_fees`. Lightning `min_htlc` / routing is not a federation fee."
 *
 * A base fee comes out of EVERY input and output of the round's locks - the players' own pool - so it is not
 * a cost of the round, it is a deduction from the stake somebody already committed. The 2% node fee is
 * inclusive and goes to the round's sitting seats for work they did; a base fee goes to the federation for
 * nothing the round asked for, and the operator must not profit from it.
 *
 * `page-lock.js` already refuses to LOCK against such a federation. This is the same refusal on the node, so
 * a signer node does not sit a round whose stakes would be shaved on the way in and out.
 *
 * AN UNKNOWN RULE IS NOT A BASE FEE. A port that answers nothing is the "no fee rule known: no lock" case the
 * client already has - the round simply mints no fee lock - and is not turned into a refusal here.
