// WHEN A RESULT THIS NODE HOLDS MAY MOVE MONEY (M3.3-32).
//
// Section 13A, through `protocol/src/objection.js`'s own `finality()`: a run
// the committee's threshold signed is PROVISIONALLY_FINAL, and it is FINAL
// when the round contract's objection window has closed with no valid
// objection. "Taking a player's stake requires a final result, an elapsed
// objection window, and a threshold quorum." Measured before this file: the
// daemon took the quorum as final and settled, cancelled and handed out shares
// 586-977 ms after the close of a round whose contract named a 3000 ms window.
//
// THE WINDOW OPENS when THIS node first held the threshold: the `seen_ms` of
// the agreeing record that completed it, off the store - so a restart does not
// open it again, and no message can open it earlier. Two signer nodes see the
// threshold at slightly different moments and close the window at slightly
// different moments; neither closes it sooner than the contract's full length
// after it could itself see the quorum.
//
// A VALID OBJECTION is what `objectionHolds` says it is: the committee's
// receipts, and a replay that contradicts the signed result. The replay a
// daemon holds is its OWN, so an objection filed at `/objection` against a run
// holds on a node that signed a different run than the threshold did, and on
// no other. Filing costs nothing, which is why a filing alone suspends
// nothing: it would let anybody hold every stake past its window and hand it
// back to its player.
