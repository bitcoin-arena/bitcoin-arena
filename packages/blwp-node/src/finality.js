// WHEN A RESULT THIS NODE HOLDS MAY MOVE MONEY (M3.3-32; §13A, WINDOW-10-SPEC, RULED Daniel 2026-10-01).
//
// A run the committee's threshold signed is PROVISIONALLY_FINAL. The objection window is exactly 600 s of wall time from
// the round's end as its contract fixes it (protocol window.js), the same instant on every node; a seat signs FINAL
// once its own clock reads close + 5 s, it holds the run PROVISIONALLY_FINAL, its transcript is posted and it holds no
// valid objection received in time; and the run is FINAL only when the round's threshold of seats (5 of 7, 2 of 2) have
// signed FINAL with times inside the 5 s tolerance of this seat's clock (protocol final-sig.js). No block decides any
// of it: blocks are where randomness comes from, not when a window ends.
//
// A VALID OBJECTION is what `objectionHolds` says it is: the committee's receipts, and a replay that contradicts the
// signed result (the replay a daemon holds is its OWN). It counts by when it reached THIS seat, on this seat's clock:
// before this seat's close + 5 s it suspends the run here - this seat never signs FINAL on it, and since FINAL needs the
// threshold, three seats that saw it in time block it. After that it suspends nothing: it is kept, flagged
// `lateObjection`, as evidence against the signers. Filing costs nothing, which is why a filing alone suspends nothing.
//
// A SUSPENDED RUN is decided by the committee's re-run, chained from the same close (RULED 2026-10-01): the re-run
// window is [end + 600 s, end + 1200 s); a re-run counts if it was signed after the objection was held here, arrived
// before this seat's end + 1205 s, and its signed time is within the tolerance. No threshold by then is §13C. With one,
// the re-run's own window is [end + 1200 s, end + 1800 s), FINAL is signed on the re-run after end + 1805 s, and a valid
// objection to the re-run received before that makes the entry VOID at once.
