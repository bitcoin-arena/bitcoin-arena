// WINNINGS ARE ALWAYS SENT, BY THE SIGNER NODES, ON A FEDERATION ROUND (Daniel 2026-09-21 13:25: "winnings are always
// sent. There is no Collect"; ruled for FEDERATION 2026-09-23 - the refund key is the committee's, the gateway is the
// lowest live key, and an invoice is taken only if its amount and its LUD-06 description hash stand).
//
// The winner names a Lightning address once, signed with the entry's session key (POST /payout-address), and after
// that nothing of the player's runs. When the round settles, the coordinating signer node proposes one SEND PLAN per
// qualifier that named an address - the invoice fetched from that address for what the lowest-key gateway's own fee
// leaves of the payout, that gateway, and an expiration inside its window - and every other signer node checks it
// for itself (protocol/winnings-send.js `sendPlanStands`) before it rebuilds the settlement, which then pays each
// such qualifier by an outgoing contract to the invoice, refunding to the committee claim key. Once the guardians
// accept the settlement, the signer nodes sign the invoice's consensus hash with the claim key - the gateway pays
// only with that signature - and the gateway is asked to pay. The preimage it reveals is checked against the
// invoice's hash and kept on every signer node: one payment row each.
//
// Every message a signer node signs it rebuilds from its own store and its own tool first: no door takes a message.
//
// AND THE DONATION SET'S 25% OF A WALK-AWAY'S LOCK (RULED Daniel 2026-09-30, destination 1), sent the same way: one plan
// per recipient of the round's donation set, its invoice fetched from that recipient's LNURL, agreed by the seats,
// kept (donation_sends, under the send id `donationSendId`), signed, asked of the gateway, and re-sent if unpaid. A
// recipient has no key, so it is paid only by the send - there is no contract only its owner could move.
