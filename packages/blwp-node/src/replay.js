// THE DAEMON REPLAYS A RUN. IT DOES NOT RUN ONE BESIDE THE PLAYER.
//
// `blwp-client/src/client.js` opens by saying why this file did not exist:
// "the node is a store... `blwp-node/src` imports no core ON PURPOSE, because
// a daemon that recomputed the state would be a second simulator and then two
// of them could disagree." That argument is against a node stepping a round
// LIVE, in parallel with the player - two engines running at once, each with
// its own idea of the present, and no way to say which is the game.
//
// This is the other thing, and section 13 requires it: seven nodes replay a
// player's FINISHED run and five must agree. That is one simulator run twice
// over the same inputs, which is the only claim determinism ever made. A node
// that cannot do it has to take the player's word for the state hash it signs
// a receipt over, and "five of seven agree" degrades to "five of seven were
// told the same thing".
//
// So the core is imported HERE and nowhere else in the daemon. One door, and
// it opens on a transcript that is already stored and already finished.
//
// THE SHAPE IS `core/tools/replay.js`, whose own header said this was coming:
// "this is the shape the node's replay pool needs - the difference there is
// that it runs in a worker and the transcript comes off the wire rather than
// off disk." Same loop, same order, no second reading of the rules.

 * are on signed objects a node already holds. `secret` is the PLAYER's, and
 * section 0.10's private world says nothing about when or whether it reaches a
 * verifier: there is no reveal message, no entry field, and no clause naming
 * one. Writing that hash here would settle a protocol question by implementing
 * it, which is the BOND_MARKER and checkpoint class of decision.
 *
 * Daniel 2026-09-08: the secret is on the Entry Contract. A node derives the
 * seed; a fixture may still hand in seedWord. Missing secret or randomness is
 * a refusal, not a guess.

 * REPLAY ONE PLAYER'S RUN FROM WHAT THE NODE ALREADY STORES.
 *
 * `transcript` is `Round#transcript()`: absolute tick numbers with five words
 * each, and sparse `[tick, size]` liquidations. `entry` is the player's signed
 * Entry Contract, which is where the START tick comes from - letter 19 fixed
 * that a late run begins at the tick its own entry names, so a replay that
 * began at zero would be replaying a different run from the one played.
 *
 * `marks` are the player's own checkpoints: `{ tick, stateHash }`. Each is
 * compared against the state THIS core reaches at that tick, and the first
 * that disagrees is named. A disagreement is not decided here - section 13
 * needs five of seven and one node is not a committee - it is reported.
 *
 * `pictures` are ticks a GHOST is wanted for (0.9 / 0.10): three truck words,
 * read off this same run at the tick it asks for. They are taken HERE, inside
 * the one loop, and not by a caller stepping its own copy - a second stepping
 * path would agree today and be the live parallel simulator the moment either
 * side changed. `ghosts.js` builds the frame and never touches the core.
 *
 * A PICTURE AT TICK N IS THE TRUCK AFTER N WAS STEPPED, which is not the mark
 * convention above and is deliberate: a mark names the state it REACHED
 * (published after stepping N-1), while a ghost names THE TICK IT IS A PICTURE
 * OF, because 11's input chain covers ticks and `ghostBinds` checks the tick
 * against the inputs that cover it. The same state is mark N+1 and ghost N.

 * THE SAME RUN, KEPT WARM, SO THE PICTURE CAN KEEP UP WITH THE TRUCK.
 *
 * `replay` starts at `init(seed)` every time it is called, which is right for
 * the thing it is for: a run that is over, replayed once, signed once. It is
 * the wrong shape for a LIVE ghost, and the difference was measured rather
 * than argued. A driver publishes a batch every 100 ms (`BatchEvery` is 6
 * ticks at 60 Hz), so a watcher's frame has to cost well under that:
 *
 *     tick     5     one frame  11.8 ms
 *     tick  1085     one frame  94.6 ms      already the whole budget
 *     tick  2165     one frame 175.9 ms
 *     tick  3599     one frame 568.9 ms      five batches behind, per watcher
 *
 *     600 frames of a 60-second run cost 110 SECONDS of simulation, and the
 *     frame cache served 0 of them - every frame replayed the run from zero.
 *
 * That is the whole of "the other truck is seen at spawn and then does not
 * follow": it keeps up for about eighteen seconds and then falls behind for
 * good, and a frame that does land is minutes old by the time it is drawn.
 *
 * SO THE STATE IS KEPT AND STEPPED FORWARD. Nothing about the simulation
 * changes: same seed, same words, same order, and a liquidation still lands
 * BEFORE its own tick and exactly once. What changes is that the ticks already
 * stepped are not stepped again. `ghost-live.test.js` measures that the pose
 * this produces is byte-identical to a full replay's at every tick, because
 * "it should be the same" is not a thing to take on trust when it is the
 * position other players are shown.
 *
 * A GHOST IS STILL A PICTURE (0.10). This runs on the NODE, off the transcript
 * the node stored, and produces three words. Nothing here is an input to
 * anybody's simulation and no browser computes any of it.
