// THE STAKE, WHILE THE ROUND IS RUNNING, AND WHERE IT ENDS UP.
//
// 23.1: the player's wallet pays a HOLD invoice for the payment hash their own
// Entry Contract carries, and from that moment the money is "accepted but not
// settled - in nobody's balance". 23.2 says what each outcome does to it, and
// `payout.js` already writes both of those down. What was missing is anything
// that runs them: measured before this file existed, `holdSettlement`,
// `holdAfter` and `invoiceMatchesEntry` had ZERO callers outside their own
// tests, and a grep for an invoice across every source and tool found only
// comments.
//
// THE OUTCOME IS THE CORE'S. A run ends DELIVERED, WRECKED or MISSED inside
// `rules/gate.js` and a node reads that word off a replay - it is not a thing
// this file decides, and it is certainly not a thing a browser reports. What
// is decided here is only which Lightning act 23.2 names for that word, and
// whether this node is allowed to make it yet.
//
// AND THE DEFAULT IS ALWAYS THE REFUND. A VOID is not a cancel: `payout.js`
// says "a cancel is an ACT, and it needs five of seven; a refund that needed
// an act is one an operator could withhold". So a void round issues NOTHING,
// the HTLC expires, and the player's wallet takes its money back without this
// node lifting a finger. A node that crashes mid-round produces the same
// answer, which is the whole reason the default is written that way.
//
// SINGLE-NODE CUSTODY, NOT §23.5. This machine has one Lightning node and the
// 2-of-2 has two daemons, so one of them is the custodian and the other is
// not. 23.5 wants every operation on the pool to need a 5-of-7 threshold
// signature; that is FROST's letter, not this one. Nothing here should be read
// as a threshold.
