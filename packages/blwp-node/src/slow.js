// WHICH PHASE HELD THE EVENT LOOP, IN THE DAEMON'S OWN LOG.
//
// Daniel 2026-09-17 19:15, the ghost letter's remainder: measured from outside the Daily, half the stalls over 300 ms
// have a [custody], [payout] or [close] line inside their window, and every picture gap over 600 ms lies inside a
// stall. That says WHICH PATH was running, not which call held the loop - `lncli` is spawned asynchronously, a
// replay runs in a worker, and a line printed during a stall is a breadcrumb, not a cause.
//
// So each phase is timed here, where the work is, and a phase that held the loop longer than the threshold says so
// with its own name. Nothing is decided by this file and no rule reads it: it logs, and a phase that is quick logs
// nothing. `BLWP_SLOW_MS` moves the threshold (default 100 ms); `BLWP_SLOW_MS=0` turns it off.
//
// AWAITED WORK IS MEASURED IN TWO NUMBERS, because they answer different questions: `held` is the synchronous stretch
// before the first await - the part a socket waits behind - and `took` is the whole call, which may be mostly waiting
// on Lightning or a peer and cost the loop nothing.
const THRESHOLD = () => {
  const named = process.env.BLWP_SLOW_MS;
  return named === undefined ? 100 : Number(named);
};
