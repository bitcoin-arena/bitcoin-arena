// Everything under it was already built and nothing called it: the pool, the
// replay and the signing were reachable only from tests, which is another way
// of saying the daemon did not do them. Section 13 has each committee node
// replay the canonical transcript once the round is over and sign what it
// found - so closing a round is the event, and this is the thing that hears it.
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND SIMULATOR AND IT HAS NO CLOCK. It reacts to a close and
// stops when the queue empties. Nothing here polls, nothing ticks, and nothing
// here reaches the core: `replay.js` remains the only file in this daemon that
// does, and this file only decides which runs are handed to it.
