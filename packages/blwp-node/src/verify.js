// WHAT THE DAEMON DOES WHEN A ROUND CLOSES.
//
// Everything under it was already built and nothing called it: the pool, the
// replay and the signing were reachable only from tests, which is another way
// of saying the daemon did not do them. Section 13 has each committee node
// replay the canonical transcript once the round is over and sign what it
// found - so closing a round is the event, and this is the thing that hears it.
//
// IT IS NOT A SECOND SIMULATOR AND IT HAS NO CLOCK. It reacts to a close and
// stops when the queue empties. Nothing here polls, nothing ticks, and nothing
// here reaches the core: `replay.js` remains the only file in this daemon that
// does, and this file only decides which runs are handed to it.

/**
 * WHERE THE ROUND'S RANDOMNESS COMES FROM, AND IT IS NOT INVENTED HERE.
 *
 * The seed stopped being a hole: Daniel put the world secret on the Entry
 * Contract (e942580) and `replay` now derives H(round_randomness || pubkey ||
 * secret || join_tick) for itself. What it still needs is the first of those
 * four, and section 5A makes it a FUTURE BITCOIN BLOCK HASH - randomness
 * nobody in the round can grind, drawn at a height after committee_time.
 *
 * That is chain state this daemon does not read yet, and a node that made one
 * up would be seeding a world its peers could not reproduce. So the source is
 * asked for and refused when absent, in `replay`'s own words. Nothing here
 * defaults it to zeros, and nothing here draws it.
