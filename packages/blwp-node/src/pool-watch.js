// WHICH BITCOIN OUTPUT HOLDS THE POOL, ASKED OF THE CHAIN.
//
// Measured before this file: nothing in `src/` could ask - no `scantxoutset`,
// no `gettxout`, no `listunspent` anywhere - and `chainSpend` can only `send`
// bytes and `look` up a txid it already has. So `payWithCommittee` took the
// output as an ARGUMENT and had no caller: a closed round stopped at
// PAYOUT_QUEUED and the winner was paid by a test handing the daemon an
// outpoint.
//
// IT IS THE SAME ADAPTER THE CENSUS READS THE CHAIN WITH. `bitcoindRpc`
// returns `call(method, params)` and that is what this takes; there is no
// second Bitcoin RPC style here, and the two methods below are bitcoind's own,
// with the shapes recorded off a running node rather than remembered:
//
//   gettxout <txid> <vout>   -> { confirmations, value, scriptPubKey: { hex } }
//                               or NULL when the output is spent or unknown
//   scantxoutset start [{desc:"raw(<hex>)"}]
//                            -> { success, unspents: [{ txid, vout, amount,
//                                 confirmations, scriptPubKey }] }
//
// A VALUE IS THE CHAIN'S, NEVER A CALLER'S. BIP-341 hashes every prevout
// amount into the sighash, so a committee signing at an amount the chain does
// not hold produces a signature the chain refuses - measured, and it can burn
// nothing. What it can do is waste a signing round, and a seat that reads the
// amount itself cannot be asked to.
