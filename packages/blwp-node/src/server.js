// The node's two doors.
//
// HTTP for the things that happen once - open a round, read it, take an entry
// - and a WebSocket for the thing that happens all round: input batches, and
// the close that ends them. That split is not decoration: a batch arrives
// sixty times a second and a round opens once, and putting both through the
// same door would mean a handshake per tick.
//
// Bodies are the protocol's own bytes, not JSON of them. The contract that
// crosses the wire is the contract that is hashed, so a node cannot
// accidentally store something that encodes differently from what it was
// given. `application/octet-stream` throughout.
//
// One process, one player, no verification. There is no bond here, no quota
// and no committee; those are M2.1 steps 4 and later, and each is refused
// rather than half-built.

/**
 * The largest frame this socket will accept, and it is derived rather than
 * chosen: it is the longest message the protocol can encode at all. A batch's
 * tick and liquidation vectors carry u16 lengths, so 1835087 bytes is the
 * ceiling the encoder itself sets; a signed checkpoint is 231 and a signed
 * receipt 139. Anything longer is not a large protocol message, it is not one.
 *
 * `ws` defaults to 104857600 - a hundred megabytes any stranger could ask the
 * daemon to allocate before a single byte was parsed. This is fifty-seven
 * times smaller and needs no policy number to justify.
 *
 * It is NOT tight. An honest client at the spec's 10 Hz sends six ticks, 227
 * bytes; a whole 9000-tick round is 180107. Tightening it further means
 * naming a maximum ticks per batch, which is a protocol-visible limit and a
 * decision rather than a measurement, so it is not made here.
