// A RUN'S INPUTS, READ OUT OF A STORE, IN ONE PLACE - so the daemon's own thread and a replay worker read them the
// same way (Daniel 2026-09-17 19:15, the ghost lag: the close held the event loop that feeds pictured trucks).
//
// Measured on the Daily with the daemon's own timing: a close held the loop 554-1511 ms before it waited, and none of
// its named steps was over 100 ms on its own - it is the per-entry work repeated, up to seven entries a round, and a
// transcript read is 21-31 ms of each. A read is not a decision and needs nothing but the store, so a worker that is
// already replaying the run can do its own reading instead of being handed the rows across a thread.
//
// NOTHING HERE TOUCHES THE SIMULATOR. It turns rows into the shape `replay` eats, and that is all it does.
