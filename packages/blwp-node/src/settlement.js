// THE SIGNER NODES' ONE SETTLEMENT OF A LOCK ROUND (W4; FEDERATION.md money flow step
// 5). Daniel 2026-09-14 07:22: "a loser loses the stake. The lock is claimed into
// the pool. Winners are paid from that."
//
// "Each signer node then rebuilds one settlement transaction from the public payout
// table. Inputs: every loser's stake lock (`Claim(P)`) ... Outputs: one payout
// contract per qualifier (a pre-expired lock, `refund_pk` = the qualifier's
// key). A signer node signs only the txid it rebuilt itself; one FROST signing covers
// every input."
//
// FROM THIS SIGNER NODE'S OWN RECORD, as the forfeit is: its own signed result for every
// entry, its own no-quorum and ENTRY_VOID records, its own finality - nothing
// waiting inside its window, nothing suspended - and the locks IT verified. The
// decision is protocol's `lockSettlement` (the hold path's own verdict over one
// payout table). Each loser's P is opened by the signer nodes' share conversation and
// must be the scalar of the point that loser's lock names. The transaction is
// rebuilt by the stock client (blwp-stake-lock --mode settle, dry), and the signer node
// signs only the 32 bytes it got back.
//
// FEES ARE NOT IN IT. The fee locks' claim hash and §22A's node slots are not
// decided (FEDERATION.md F5); the fee lock expires back to its player as before.
