// A SEAT VERIFIES THE PLAYER'S STAKE LOCK (v4.6.2 §23.1 step 5).
//
// "STAKE_COMMITTED is recorded once >=5 settlement nodes have VERIFIED the
// locks: the contract id at stake_lock_outpoint (and the fee lock's) equals
// the hash of a contract whose payment_image is the entry's stake_point,
// whose amount is the entry's net stake, whose claim_pk is the attested key,
// whose refund_pk is player_pubkey, and whose expiration is >= current height
// + stake_expiry_blocks. Seeing the lock is not enough: the player built it."
//
// This is one seat's half. The player hands the seat the contract it locked;
// the seat asks the federation what it holds at the entry's outpoint (the
// stored contract id and the blocks left to its expiry), hashes the handed
// contract with the stock client's own rule, and requires the two to be one
// contract; then protocol stake-lock.js `lockMatchesEntry` checks every field
// against the entry. Only then is the stake seen - the same record the play
// gate reads, so a verified lock and a held HTLC open play the same way.
//
// THE FEDERATION IS A PORT, as Lightning is: `status(outpoint)` answers
// `{ blockCount, stored: { contractId, blocksLeft } | null }` and
// `contractId(fields)` the stock hash (blwp-stake-lock, over the Rust client
// crates). The fee lock is not checked here: its claim hash and the §22A node
// slots wait on a ruling (PRIORITIES).
