// CHAIN ACCESS COMES FROM TWO SETTINGS AND NO OTHERS:
//
//     BLWP_BITCOIND_URL      the bitcoind RPC, e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8332/
//     BLWP_BITCOIND_COOKIE   the path of its .cookie file
//     BLWP_FUNDED_ROUNDS     round ids this operator funds (paying rounds only)
//     BLWP_FUNDED_ROUNDS_FILE  the same, one id per line, read on every ask
//     BLWP_STAKE_LOCK_BIN    blwp-stake-lock (tools/stake-lock), for stake-lock rounds
//     BLWP_FEDERATION_CLIENT_DIR  the data dir of a client joined to the round's federation
//
// AND WHAT A LAUNCHER USED TO HAND ITS IN-PROCESS NODES, for nodes that run as their own processes (attach, Daniel
// 2026-09-29: the seven blwp-tn4-node units own the guardians; tools/run-testnet4-paid.mjs BLWP_ATTACH=1):
//     BLWP_CLOSE_AT_END=1         this node closes every round that is over, itself
//     BLWP_DONATION_NETWORK       regtest | testnet4: the network's signed test donation set, which the rounds name
//     BLWP_ATTACH_PROOF_DIR       the launcher's headers.bin and bond.json, served on GET /headers and GET /bond,
//                                 read at every ask (the launcher writes them once the nodes are up)
//
// Both or neither. With them the daemon can read each round's beacon and derive each round's census - which is where it
// learns the other signer nodes' addresses, from the advertisements in their bonds. (It no longer finds a pool output or
// sends a pool payout: that was the withdrawn custody's, §23.6, RULED 2026-09-25.)
//
// HOW FAR BACK A CENSUS IS READ: CENSUS_LOOKBACK blocks before a round's
// census height. A bond funded earlier than that is not seen by a restarted
// daemon, and a round whose committee holds one is refused by name.
