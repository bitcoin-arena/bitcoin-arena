// for exactly that property; putting it in later would be a migration, and
// putting it in the caller would mean every future caller has to remember it.
//
// A gap needs nothing at all: ticks are absolute, so `MAX(tick)` against
// `COUNT(*)` says whether any are missing, and which ones is a query rather
// than a reconstruction.
//
// Nothing here steps the core. The node stores and serves; it does not judge.
