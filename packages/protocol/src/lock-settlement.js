// THE ROUND'S ONE SETTLEMENT OF STAKE LOCKS (FEDERATION.md, money flow step 5;
// W4 - Daniel 2026-09-14 07:22: "a loser loses the stake. The lock is claimed
// into the pool. Winners are paid from that.").
//
// THE VERDICT IS THE HOLD PATH'S OWN. `holdSettlement` over one payout table
// decides each entry, so a lock round and a hold round cannot decide the same
// round differently:
//   SETTLE   a loser's stake lock, claimed as an input (`Claim(P)`)
//   CANCEL   a qualifier's own lock, forfeited back to them (forfeit.js, W5b)
//   NOTHING  the lock is left to expire back to its player (VOID, a Delivered run
//            below the score)
// The outputs are one PRE-EXPIRED payout contract per qualifier owed a share:
// `refund_pk` = the key that qualifier's own stake lock names, so only they can
// ever move it (FEDERATION.md source audit, point 2). A qualifier's own stake is
// not in it - that half comes back by the forfeit (`winnings`, as on a hold).
//
// THE GUARDIANS' FEES, AND WHO BEARS THEM. Every input and every output pays
// `base + amount * ppm / 1e6` (lnv2-common config.rs), read from the federation
// (`blwp-stake-lock --mode fees`). They come out of the pool pro rata to what
// each qualifier is owed: target = floor(owed * spendable / pool), then the
// largest payout with payout + fee(payout) <= target. What the floors leave is no
// output and stays with the guardians as fee; a share too small to pay its own
// output fee is reported unpaid, not bumped from anyone else's.
//
// ONE TRANSACTION EVERY SIGNER NODE REBUILDS BYTE FOR BYTE: inputs sorted by outpoint,
// payouts by payout key, and the nonce derived from the round id - so the signer nodes
// sign one txid, and a signer node signs only the txid it rebuilt itself.
// AND THE FEE LOCKS (Pick A, Daniel 2026-09-14): every counted entry's fee lock -
// winners' too, the fee is owed whatever the result (F5) - claimed with its F,
// handed over openly at entry, in the same transaction and the same signature.
// They pay the round's SITTING SIGNER NODES by §22A's own weights (`nodeFeeTable`: 1% to
// the game/verify pool, 1% to the settlement pool, per eligible signer node, leftovers in
// the round's order), each signer node one pre-expired payout contract to its own key -
// never to the donation recipients, and no split invented here. A VOID or
// ENTRY_VOID entry's fee lock is not claimed: §22A's fee base leaves it out.
