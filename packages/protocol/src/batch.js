// An input batch: what a player sends while a round is running.
//
// THE SHAPE IS THE CORE'S, not a new one. `packages/core`'s `step` takes
// throttle, steer, brake, handbrake and practice, in that order, and the
// golden vectors record exactly those five per tick. A batch carries the same
// five in the same order, so a node's transcript and a golden vector are the
// same list of numbers and a round can be replayed by handing them to `step`
// unchanged.
//
// AND THE LIQUIDATIONS, which the five do not carry. A liquidation reaches the
// core through `submitLiquidation` between ticks, not through `step`, so a
// transcript with only the five would replay a round with no strike, no
// crater and no fallout in it - a different game from the one that was
// played. They are sparse because they are rare: `[tick, size]`, the same
// shape `test-vectors/*.json` uses.
//
// AND THE LOAD, which the five do not carry either. What went on the bed
// decides how hard the war hunts the truck, and it used to be a HOST WRITE:
// Unity worked the wanted level out in floats and pushed the answer through
// `BlwpSetHeat`, which is in no batch, no mark and no transcript. The page's
// core carried 57229 and every replay of the same transcript carried 0, so a
// committee - and every ghost a committee draws - walked a run the war was
// hunting less hard than it hunted the player. `[tick, feeSats,
// btcHundredths]`, sparse like the liquidations, because a load is declared
// at roll-out and rarely again; the core decides what it costs.
//
// AND THE PRICE SAMPLES (Daniel 2026-09-17 16:01: the chart was frozen - nothing ever submitted one). The live
// BTCUSD price every 300 ticks moves the tape, the candles, the seam and the market the army reads, so a transcript
// without them replays a different war. `[tick, price]` (the tape's unit, 256 a dollar), sparse like the
// liquidations. Written only when there are any: a batch without samples is byte for byte the batch it was before,
// so every stored batch keeps its id.
//
// AND THEY ARE CHAINED. `previous_hash` is the spec's own field (section 11):
// each batch names the one before it, so a transcript is an ordered object
// rather than a bag of rows that happen to sit in a table. Without it, "hand
// me the transcript" means "hand me whatever you have and trust it is all of
// it"; with it, a missing or altered batch breaks the chain at a named place.
// The first batch of a round chains to thirty-two zero bytes.
//
// Ticks are absolute, not relative to the batch. A repeat is then harmless -
// the node writes the same tick number twice and keeps one - and a gap is
// visible, because the numbers themselves say what is missing. That is the
// property `M2.1` step 2 needs and it costs nothing to have from the start.
