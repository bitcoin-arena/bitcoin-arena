// verify the hash against its known-good list of reproducibly built core
// versions, and MUST refuse - or require an explicit, clearly worded override -
// for unknown hashes. Otherwise a creator could publish a round running a
// backdoored core." This client refuses. There is no override: no flag, no
// query parameter, nothing that lets an unknown core through.
//
// F2's second clause rests on it (FEDERATION.md): the player's key is theirs
// only if the code that decides the round is code they can know.
