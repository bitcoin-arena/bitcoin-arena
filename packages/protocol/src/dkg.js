// THE COMMITTEE MAKES ITS OWN KEY, AND NOBODY EVER HOLDS IT.
//
// M3.3 item 14. Item 10 closed FROST against RFC 9591's own vectors and said
// what it had not done: the group secret came from a TRUSTED DEALER. Item 17
// put the signing on sockets - five daemons, one share each, no secret on the
// wire - which distributes the SIGNING and not the KEY. Measured before any of
// this was written (`dkg-dealer.test.js`): the dealing process held 7 of 7
// shares, five of them interpolate to the group secret, and `trustedDealerSplit`
// had zero callers under any `src/` - so the dealer was not code in this
// repository at all, it was whatever process started the seven daemons.
//
// PEDERSEN, AND IT IS n PARALLEL FELDMAN DEALS. Every seat picks a secret,
// splits it to all seats with `splitSecret`, publishes the polynomial's
// commitments and seals one share to each seat's key. Every seat then adds up
// the shares it was dealt: that sum is its share of a group secret equal to the
// sum of everybody's, which no seat and no observer ever computes. The group
// key is the sum of the constant-term commitments, and every seat works it out
// from public data alone.
//
// WHAT IS REUSED AND WHY. `splitSecret` already cuts a polynomial and publishes
// Feldman commitments; `sealShare`/`openShare` already put one share in an
// envelope only one seat's key opens; `shareOpensTo` is already the check that
// a share lies on the published polynomial - the whole of letter 29. None of
// that is rewritten here. What is new is the ROUND: who deals to whom, what a
// seat must have before it may combine, and the refusals.
//
// THE CURVE IS INJECTED, like everywhere else in this package: nothing here
// vendors an implementation of the thing that pins money.
