// A ROUND SERIES: ONE PUBLICATION, A NEW ROUND EVERY 90 s, WRITTEN 72 h AHEAD (multiplayer_p2p.md §5A.5 "Round series";
// Daniel 2026-09-28, 18738972 and HORIZON72-1131 / NODE72-1131).
//
// The unit anchored on chain is a SERIES: its template - every field of a Round Contract, its committee_time and its
// start - is hashed once, and `OP_RETURN "BLW" SERIES series_id` publishes it. Round `i` of it is derived, never
// authored: the template with start_time = series_start + i * 90 s and its entry closing at that start (every run of a
// round starts together). Nothing per round is chosen after the beacon, so a series grinds no better than one round.
//
// THE TIMES ARE THE SPEC'S, counted back from the series' start:
//
//     committee_time(k)  = series_start(k) - 84 h        (its beacon at depth before series_start - 72 h)
//     census_height(k)   = the highest block whose MTP <= series_start(k) - 120 h
//     series_lead_min    = 72 h: every round exists 72 h before it takes an entry, and a node refuses a series
//                          whose start is less than 72 h after its committee_time
//
// NOT YET HERE, and said rather than papered over: `round_id(i) = H(series_id || i)` needs a Round Contract that
// carries its series id and index; until the contract format does, a series round's id is its derived contract's
// hash, which is as fixed by the series as the spec's id is. `genesis_series_start` is not a genesis parameter yet,
// so a series names its own start, checked here against the 72 h lead and the 90 s grid.
