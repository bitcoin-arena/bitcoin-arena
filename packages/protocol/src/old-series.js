// PICK B (RULED Daniel 2026-09-30 08:55, OLD-BEACON-0850): ONE NAMED EXCEPTION TO THE NETWORK IDENTITY AND TO THE SERIES
// LEAD AND GRID RULES, FOR ONE SERIES.
//
// Series 3cfbe516d93ddf4b was published on testnet4 (3029fc6f, block 154237; beacon 154268; committee_time 2026-09-28
// 19:52:05Z; start 2026-09-29 19:52:05Z) under the testnet4 network id as it stood then, 26b9162e... . 04c5ecec made
// genesis_series_start a genesis parameter the next day, which moved testnet4's id to bf876cb1... and put its series
// grid at 2026-10-01 - so every node refused this series as another network's, off the grid, and held to the 72 h lead a
// network nobody knows gets (a node loading it exited). Ruled: the current code accepts THIS series from the old id,
// beside bf876cb1; 24 h before its start (testnet4's own lead) is enough; beacon 154268 still counts. Nothing else of the
// old id is taken: a round naming it that is not a round of this series is refused (server.js POST /round).
