// `computePayoutTable` was wired into it.
//
// 22A gives the whole of it and leaves nothing to taste:
//
//   gross_round_volume = sum of stake of every financially activated entry
//   node_fee = 2.00% of gross_round_volume
//   1.00% -> GAME/VERIFY pool (7 slots)
//   1.00% -> SETTLEMENT pool (7 slots)
//   ...unearned shares are redistributed pro rata among the other eligible
//   nodes in the same role pool, keeping the total at 2%.
//   Remainders. Calculate in millisatoshis, floor each base share, and
//   distribute the remaining msat in ascending H(round_id || node_pubkey).
//
// MILLISATOSHI BIGINT THROUGHOUT, like every other money path here. The
// percentages are basis points and integer division; nothing is a float, and
// the remainder a floor leaves behind is handed out rather than kept.
