// A node advertisement: who a node is, and where to reach it.
//
// WHY IT IS ON THE CHAIN AT ALL. Section 25.1 is blunt about the difference
// between finding a round and finding the nodes: "Finding a ROUND is not
// authoritative: project website, community sites, a direct link, a QR code,
// or a copied round_id... Finding the NODES is a different matter and is not
// left open: it is chain state."
//
// So the four steps of its table are answered like this: a round comes from a
// link and carries nothing; which nodes count is the bond outputs confirmed
// and unspent at `census_height`; which are on the committee is arithmetic,
// already in `sortition.js`; and WHERE TO REACH THEM is this object, carried
// by the bond funding transaction. There is no directory, no relay network and
// no seed list belonging to this protocol, and this is the piece that makes
// that possible rather than merely stated.
//
// IT IS NOT WHAT MAKES A NODE ELIGIBLE. Section 5A.1: "The advertisement is
// not what makes a node eligible. The bond output is. The advertisement is the
// body that the bond output commits to, so that chain data alone identifies
// both the node and its terms." That is why `bondOutpoint` is mandatory here -
// the object points back at the thing that gives it weight - and why the
// commitment lives in `chain.js` rather than here.
//
// THE SIGNATURE SITS BESIDE IT, as it does for a checkpoint and a receipt, and
// for the same reason twice over. Inside, it would be covered by `advertId`,
// so the id of an advertisement would change the moment it was signed - and
// the bond output commits to the BODY, which is fixed when the funding
// transaction is built. Section 5A.1 lists `signature` among the fields; this
// keeps it adjacent so the commitment and the id are both stable.
