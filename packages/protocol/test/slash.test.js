// 5A.3B: A FRAUD PROOF, AND THE BOND IT NAMES.
//
// 13C's fourth clause and the last of them: "nodes whose signature contradicts
// a replay of the canonical transcript are slashed". 5A.3 gives the offence
// and its proof - transcript + receipts + replay - and 5A.3B gives the five
// steps from proof to transaction. Steps 3 and 5 are an arbitration set with
// MuSig2 keys and a broadcast, which is a daemon and is not here. Steps 1, 2
// and 4 are a portable object, a mechanical check and a hash, which are.
//
// No curve in this file for the same reason there is none in the package: what
// is checked is that the evidence IS the result the proof accuses, and whose
// signature it carries is the caller's to verify.
