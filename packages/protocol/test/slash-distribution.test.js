// 5A.3: WHERE A SLASHED BOND GOES.
//
// "Slashed bonds are distributed: half to the affected players of that round;
// the other half 75% evenly to the active census nodes at the slashing height
// minus the round's own seats (the witnesses) and 25% to the donation set of
// §22A - the developers. Nothing is ever burned (RULED, Daniel 2026-09-21),
// here or anywhere in this protocol ... so every remainder in this document has
// a recipient."
//
// THE WITNESSES ARE SUBTRACTED, NOT PAID. This suite used to assert the
// withdrawn rule - the other half to "the remaining honest committee members",
// which is the exact set the sentence above takes out. Measured on a clean
// 100000 sat bond under that rule: the two seats took 25000 each and the census
// took nothing. The numbers below are the spec's.
//
// Pure, and it moves nothing: this says who is owed what out of a bond that
// has been spent. Spending it is 5A.3B steps 3 and 5 - an arbitration set with
// MuSig2 keys - and is not here.
