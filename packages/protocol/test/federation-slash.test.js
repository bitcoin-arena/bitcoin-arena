// THE THREE WAYS THE HALT CASE GETS GOT WRONG, EACH HELD DOWN BY A TEST.
//
// Daniel 2026-09-21: on a halt the slashed bonds pay the note holders and nothing is left for anyone who
// runs the network; the exposure cap is four of the smallest bond and not the sum of ten; and a halt's
// abandonment proof cannot ask for attestations a halted federation no longer has. Each of these fails
// loudly if the old rule comes back.
