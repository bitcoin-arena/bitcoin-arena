// A SETTLEMENT RECOVERED AFTER A RESTART INDEXES ITS DONATION-KEY OUTPUTS (kanban #152, Daniel 2026-10-07). A seat restarted
// between submitting a walk-away's settlement and finding it in the federation marked it ACCEPTED ("found in the federation

// what is written; only the plan rebuild (planOf) and the federation's answers are stubbed, as the restart leaves them.
