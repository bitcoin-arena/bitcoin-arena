// THE SEED SLICE (IMPLEMENTATION.md §12.1, RULED Daniel 2026-09-25): the node and the fixtures read the round's beacon
// from the bonded chain, and players and the node seed the world from that same hash. Measured here only what does not
// depend on who delivers:
//   1. every holder names the same beacon - the bonded chain's own block, and another round's chain names another;
//   2. the seed and the committee both derive from it - the roster's committee seed is committeeSeedFromBeacon over that
//      hash, and the player's mark, seeded from it, is the state the node's own stored transcript replays to;
//   3. a round on a fixed beacon replays bit-identically - the same contract mines the same beacon again, and every
//      replay of a holder's stored transcript under it reaches the same state, outcome and score.
// No run here is asked to deliver: the recorded tape (wordsAt) was recorded on another world, and a test that needs a
// specific scripted entry to deliver on a beacon-seeded round is a listed red of this slice (TASKBOOK).
