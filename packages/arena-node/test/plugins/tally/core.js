// TALLY: THE SECOND, MINIMAL TEST GAME (kanban #202, Daniel 2026-10-07: "a round of a second, minimal test plugin opens,
// replays and settles on the same nodes as nextblock").
//
// Nothing like the truck: each tick takes one input number (the first of the five words a batch carries per tick), the
// score is their sum, and a run finishes at its round's run length - DELIVERED, scored by the sum. It answers the same
// adapter face every core does (start, eventsOf, step, stateHash, result, runTicksFits) and draws no picture: `picture`
// is a game's optional extra, and the engine must not need it.
