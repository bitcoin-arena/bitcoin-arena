// the 60 s average at its start (a tie Up; Chainlink's TWAP 60 s stream read at both ends, kanban #236 comment 1154), outcome by 2 of its 3 attestors, refused before the window's end, VOID 10 minutes after it with no
// outcome. Its developer and attestor keys are TEST keys (testDevKey's words): regtest only.
