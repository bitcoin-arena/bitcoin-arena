// THE DAILY'S PAYING ROUND IS A FEDERATION ROUND, ON ITS OWN SEVEN (HARD, Daniel 2026-09-23 10:19: "New paying
// rounds are FEDERATION now"; ruled 2026-09-21: the committee is the 5-of-7 already in the protocol).
//
// `run-2of2.mjs` used to open its paying kind as THRESHOLD_LN on the free pair, with the committee's own
// Lightning holding the stakes. That custody is withdrawn and no longer encodes, so the launcher's paying
// round names the federation it locks into, and it refuses to start one without that federation - by name,
// before it creates or binds anything. What it opens with a federation was measured against a real one
// (TASKBOOK, 2026-09-23); this pins the refusals, which a launcher reaches with no federation at all.
