// A SECOND TITLE ON THE SAME SIGNER NODES - THE ACCEPTANCE FOR M3 R1 (Daniel 2026-09-15 08:07: "several
// games at once, and several rule sets at once ... two titles and two configs can run on the same
// nodes in the same window").

// Deliberately nothing like the truck: a run adds its first input word each tick, for its config's
// number of ticks, and delivers when the sum reaches its config's target. It is here to show the
// signer nodes replay whatever core a round names, under whatever config it names, and that the truck is
// not special to them: the same adapter face (core/src/adapter.js), its own hash, its own configs.
