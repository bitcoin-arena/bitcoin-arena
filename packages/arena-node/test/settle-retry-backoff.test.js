// A REFUSED SETTLE IS OFFERED AGAIN, BUT IT DOES NOT SPIN (kanban #229, Daniel 2026-10-07 08:35): on code-seat29 a plan no
// peer could take ("this signer node knows no peer to hand the send plan to yet") was offered again every second, 120
// times per round, each offer a whole settle pass - every seat near one core. The first offers stay quick (a peer not yet
// final becomes final within seconds, which is why the retry exists); later ones wait longer, up to a minute.
