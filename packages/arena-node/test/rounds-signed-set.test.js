// THE LISTING'S ROW SIGNATURES, SIGNED ON DEMAND ONE WINDOW AT A TIME (2026-10-08; it was 's
// background set). Measured live before: every ~45 s each testnet4 seat signed every announced row - 1,857, ~6.5 s of
// BIP-340 in a new worker - about 23 of its 29 % CPU, while the lobby asks for a handful. Now a row is signed the first time
// a listing in the window names it and served from that signature for the rest of the window; nothing asked, nothing
// signed. Every row still checks the page's way (lobby.js: one nowMs for the listing, the row's own facts), a row whose
// signed facts changed is signed again at once, and a new window (45 s) signs again what it is asked.
