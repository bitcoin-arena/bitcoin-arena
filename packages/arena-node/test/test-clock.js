// THE FIXTURES' SHARED CLOCK THAT SKIPS (§13A, WINDOW-10-SPEC, RULED Daniel 2026-10-01): the objection window is exactly
// 600 s of wall time from the round's end, and no test waits ten real minutes. Every fixture daemon reads this clock as
// its round store's (`roundClock`): the wall clock plus an offset that only grows. `skipTo(ms)` moves every daemon in the
// process to that instant at once - one network, one time - and nothing in between happens: the windows close as they
// would ten minutes later. One clock per process; node --test runs each file in its own.
