// AN ATTESTED ROUND'S DOOR AND ITS SETTLEMENT, ON TWO SIGNER NODES AND THE FAKE FEDERATION (kanban #206 slice 2, §0A.7a;
// Daniel 2026-10-07, plan 777):
//   - the door: an attestation before the round's entries close, or one observed before they closed, refused by name;
//   - final 600 s after the first standing attestation: inside it nothing settles, and a contradiction makes it DISPUTED;
//   - past it the seats settle the pari-mutuel table by themselves (the sweep): the losers' stake locks and every fee lock
//     claimed, each winner paid its share of the losing pool to its own key, the seats their §22A fee; the winners' own
//     stake locks not claimed;
//   - nobody right: only the fee locks are claimed;
//   - no attestation at all: nothing is claimed;
//   - a contradiction after the settlement is held as proof and undoes nothing.
