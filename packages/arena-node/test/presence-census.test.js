// fixture chain: six bonded nodes, rounds of 3 seats drawing 3; node 5 is stopped. Its absence is proven by three seating certificates
// of other rounds of the 24 h, signed for real by their seated: drawn there, present at none. The seat serves a round whose root leaves
// node 5 out, and the client - from headers, the rounds' contracts and their census evidence alone - checks the same proofs and draws
// the seat's committee. A claim naming an honest node, a claim of 2 seatings, a forged or an under-threshold certificate: refused by
// the seat and by the client, by name. The presence book: the posting node's claim with its certificates, from what it holds and asks.
