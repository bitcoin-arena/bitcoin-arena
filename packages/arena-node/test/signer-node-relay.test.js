// A ROUND THAT TAKES A STAKE MUST NAME A PUBLICATION RELAY, OR IT TAKES NO STAKE.
//
// Since P2 (v4.6.2 §13A) no result is FINAL until the round's settlement signer nodes
// have posted its transcript to the contract's `publication_relays[]` - and a
// contract that names none can never be posted to, so none of its results can
// ever be final and no stake in it can ever settle.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE (TASKBOOK, e76cc61): two daemons opened such a round (201,
// 201), joined, quoted and held both players' stakes on both signer nodes, and 4.5 s
// after the close every stake was still HELD and every result provisional,
// with 0 Lightning acts. Now the round is refused where it is opened, and a
// stake is refused where it would be joined - before any hold is issued.
// A PAYING ROUND OPENS ONLY ON A SIGNER NODE THAT REACHES A FEDERATION (RULED Daniel 2026-09-25): this file's paying-round
// daemons get the lock fixture's port - the test federation, two gateways, zero base fee. Contracts unchanged.
