/**
 * A CHAIN THAT BONDS A ROUND'S COMMITTEE (RULED Daniel 2026-09-25: a paying round opens only on a signer node that reads the
 * chain - it counts the federation's guardians on the census, assigns its signer nodes from it, and seeds from its beacon).
 *
 * Two steps, because a daemon is made before its key - the contract's `nodes` - is known:
 *   bondedChainSlot(port)   made first: the `chainFor` / `randomnessFor` pair a daemon is served with, and `port` (the lock
 *                           fixture's, by default) answering guardians() for the federation the round names.
 *   bondedChainFor(nodes, contract, slot)   once the keys exist: one bond per node - exactly the contract's nodes, the
 *                           keyless ones and placeholders included - each for game and settlement and each advertising
 *                           one guardian key of that federation; the round's publication; the census it derives. Returns
 *                           the two fields the chain dictates and nothing else: `censusRoot` (what the bonds derive to)
 *                           and `committeeTimeMs` (the contract's own: the chain is mined around it). The fixture
 *                           spreads those two into its contract before it takes the round id (RULED 2026-09-25).
