// A SECOND GAME ON THE SAME NODES AS NEXTBLOCK (kanban #202, Daniel 2026-10-06/07: "Done when a round of a second,
// minimal test plugin opens, replays and settles on the same nodes as nextblock").
//
// Two signer nodes host two games: nextblock (core/plugin/nextblock.js, as the launcher hands it) and tally
// (test/plugins/tally: one input number a tick, the score is the sum, a run finishes at its round's run length). A paying
// tally round opens on them, two players play it, the nodes replay each run with tally's core and sign that core's
// results, and the round settles ACCEPTED. Then a paying nextblock round opens on the same two nodes and settles too. A
// round naming a game neither node hosts is refused at the door, by its id, and nothing of it is stored.
