// A RUN ENDS, AND IT ENDS WHERE THE CORE SAYS.
//
// Section 6 names `player_run_duration` and this Round Contract does not carry
// it - and never needed to. The core owns it as `BLOCK_TICKS` in
// `rules/gate.js`, counts it as `S_ELAPSED` while the run is LIVE so a late
// joiner gets a whole mission (0.8), and `genesis.js` writes that number into
// the config hash a round's `network_id` commits to. A second signed copy
// would be a second clock, which letter 21 forbade.
//
// MEASURED BEFORE ANY OF THIS EXISTED, and it is why the letter is not just a
// comment: a round naming 9000, one naming 4500 and one naming 1 were all
// accepted; 9600 ticks of a 9000-tick run were all stored and all replayed;
// and `transcriptBelongsToEntry` reported the run length as unchecked.
