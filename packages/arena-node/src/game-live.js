// HOW MANY PLAY EACH GAME HERE NOW (kanban #338, Daniel 2026-10-11: "Anzeigen wieviele nodes das haben und wieviele spieler
// insgesamt drin sind"): per game this seat hosts, the rounds that are live now - open for entries or running - and the
// players entered in them, from this seat's own round store - live from the seating close (start - 120 s) to the end. Each round's contract is read once (by rowid), the entries
// counted with one query; the answer is kept 10 s, so GET /games stays cheap however often the chooser asks.
