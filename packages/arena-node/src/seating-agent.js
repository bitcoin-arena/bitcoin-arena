//   at seating_close                      it computes the seated from the PRESENTs it holds (seating.js seatedFrom) and,
//                                         if it is seated, signs that SEATING - once per round and role, kept before it is
//                                         served - and gathers the other seated nodes' signatures over the same seating
//                                         (GET /seating-sig); with every one, the certificate (GET /seating)
//   after seating_close, before start     a seated node whose seating can never stand - a member of it signed a seating that does
//                                         not come before it (kanban #738) - takes the PRESENTs it lacked from the others and signs
//                                         once more: the seating of what it holds now, and only one another node has signed -
//                                         in a 22 round with its justification, the member's signed seating (RULED 2026-10-28),
//                                         bound in the signature (kanban #746)
//   any time                              a second valid certificate for one round and role is equivocation: both are
//                                         kept as the proof (GET /seating-equivocation), and the round takes no entries
//
// FROM PROTOCOL 22 THE SEATED ALSO SIGN WHO WAS PRESENT (§5A.3, kanban #727, Daniel 2026-10-27): with its SEATING signature a seated
// node signs a SEEN - every node it held a PRESENT of at the close, and the nodes the round's census left out as absent - and the
// certificate is made only with every seated node's SEEN in it. Those certificates are the only proof that leaves a node out of a
// census. A node the round's census left out may hand in a PRESENT though it is not drawn: that is how it comes back.
//
// The roster asks `seatedFor` and seats the certificate's nodes; before one stands, the draw's first slots (Roster).
