// THE SIGNER NODES' FORFEIT OF A QUALIFIER'S STAKE LOCK (v4.6.2 §23.2 row 1, W5b).
//
// "DELIVERED (qualifying): forfeit the stake lock -> it returns to the
// player's key. Requires: threshold settlement signature over the lock,
// published; the player's own client redeems it, and only the player can."
// A forfeit is a BIP-340 signature by the round's claim_pk over the lock's
// contract id (fedimint lnv2: `forfeit_message` is the id); the guardians then
// let the lock be spent with `Cancel(sig)`, and the transaction must be signed
// by the lock's refund_pk - the player. So a forfeit can only return money to
// its owner; what it must never be is a signature a loser can use.
//
// POOLSIGNING'S RULE, FOR A DIFFERENT MESSAGE: a signer node signs only a forfeit it
// rebuilt itself. Nobody hands it a contract id. The asker names the round and
// the entry; the signer node rebuilds the contract from the lock IT verified, and
// signs only if ITS OWN finality says the run is FINAL - window closed - and
// ITS OWN result says the run qualifies (§18: DELIVERED and score >=
// min_score). A loser's, a run inside its window, a Delivered run below the
// score: refused, by name.
//
// THE NONCES LIVE IN MEMORY, ONE PAIR PER MESSAGE, and a pair signs ONE
// commitment list: the same nonce over two lists is two signatures over two
// messages, which publishes the share. A second asker with the same list gets
// the same share back; with another list, nothing.
