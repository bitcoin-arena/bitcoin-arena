// THE LISTING'S ROW SIGNATURES, SIGNED OFF THE SEAT'S THREAD (kanban #197). A seat signs every announced round's row for
// one time every ~45 s (server.js, the background-signed full listing) - 2,281 BIP-340 signatures at ~3.2 ms each on the
// live testnet4 seats. Signed in 15 ms slices on the seat's own loop, one set took 12-17 s of wall time on a loaded
// Beelink, and sets aged past the 55 s a listing may be served. Here the messages (each row's lobbyListingId, made on the
// seat's thread) cross to a worker, which signs them and answers the signatures in the same order. The key crosses as
// bytes, once per set, and never leaves the process.
