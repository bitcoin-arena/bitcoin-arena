// WHICH GRID SERIES' POSTING TO LOOK FOR NEXT, AND WHEN TO LOOK AGAIN (kanban #742, Daniel 2026-10-29 ~23:10Z: "Löse das im Code dass sowas
// verworfen wird in Zukunft"). Measured that night: emergency postings of 10-30 at 158103, after the day's lead emergency at 158082, were
// dropped by the Beelink seats within minutes, but Mac seat 1 still held three of them 30 min later and an hour before the day - under a
// load of 130-180 its chain view for them was still being read, the pass took that for "no posting" and looked again only after 10 min
// (ARENA_DUP_ASK_MS), one series per 2 s pass. A day that has begun is never decided, so a seat that misses the hour before it keeps the
// duplicate all day. Now: the day starting soonest is looked at first; a view still being read is asked again in 15 s; a series of a day
// that starts within DUP_SOON_MS is asked again every minute; only the rest waits DUP_ASK_MS.
