 * A NODE FETCHES THE DAY'S SERIES ITSELF (kanban #757, 2026-10-28: "today's rounds don't seat"). The poster pushes each series line
 * (POST /series) to every census node at the endpoint its bond advert names. An installed node whose tunnel address changed since its
 * advert (b36828fa: advert cups-grades-..., reachable at top-linda-jose-visibility) never got a push, and a node that did get one refused
 * it (402: only its own operator's funded file names a series funded). Drawn in 67 of the day's rounds, it held none of them: it could
 * not list, seat, sign PRESENT for or play any.
 *
 * So every node asks the nodes it knows, every PULL_EVERY_MS: which series do you hold (GET /series), and for each one it does not hold,
 * its line (GET /series-template?id=). A line is believed only when it hashes to the id asked for; `take(template)` then checks it as
 * POST /series does - creator signature, lead, hosted game, donation set, federation - and, in place of the operator naming it funded,
 * that the series' publication is confirmed on this node's own chain. A series refused is asked again after RETRY_MS (its publication
 * may not be confirmed yet, its view may still be reading).
 *
 *   peers()         the other nodes' roots (http/https), the announced address first
 *   held()          the ids (hex) of the series this node holds
 *   take(t)         -> { ok, why } for a parsed series line
 *   parse(line)     series-line.js parseSeriesLine;  idOf(t) -> the series id, hex
