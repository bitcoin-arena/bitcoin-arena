// HOW LONG THIS NODE WAS UP (kanban #756, george-prime in Arena Chat 1385: "Show the 24h uptime that is important for node inclusion ...
// and also when it is not reached. Also display 7d uptime and 30d uptime and all time uptime").
//
// WHAT IS KEPT: before this the node kept no record of its own running - no start or stop mark, no heartbeat of its own on this line.
// So from this release on it keeps one: `uptime_spans`, one row per stretch it ran, (start_ms, end_ms). While it runs it moves the
// newest row's end to now every UPTIME_TICK_MS; a start within UPTIME_GAP_MS of the newest row's end continues that row (a restart of
// seconds is not an outage), a later start opens a new row. A crash loses at most one tick. Nothing older than the first row is known,
// and nothing is estimated for it: a window that reaches back past the first row is the share of the time since the first row, and
// says so ("since <date>").
//
// WHAT THE 24 H MEANS FOR THE DRAW (multiplayer_p2p.md §5A.3 "Absent from its seatings", protocol 22, kanban #727): from protocol 22
// only nodes seen in the 24 h before the census are drawn. A node is seen when it is listed at one seating or one heartbeat slot (one per
// round, every 15 min on a 15-min grid); it is left out only when certificates prove it missed 3 of them at least 1 h apart and it was
// seen at none. In uptime terms: a node that ran without a break for one heartbeat interval (UPTIME_SLOT_MS) in the last 24 h was up at
// a slot's close and is kept; one that did not was seen nowhere and is left out of the next census (its bond untouched) until it is.
// Before protocol 22 (2026.1.9.x) uptime decides no draw (§5A.3 "Deliberately NOT eligibility criteria"): a drawn node that is down
// only loses that seat to a reserve and its fee share - the figure is shown with the rule it will meet from 2.0.
