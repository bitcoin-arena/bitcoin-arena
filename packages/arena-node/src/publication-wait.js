// A PUBLISHED ROUND FIRST, ITS BEACON AFTER (Daniel 2026-09-30, the fcb15cca refusal, pick (b)).
//
// Measured on testnet4: the paying runner broadcast round fcb15cca's publication (37af92a0, 2 sat/vB) at 21:48:57Z;
// it sat in the mempool ~3.5 h and confirmed at 154489, after the round's beacon block (~154477). The runner had
// waited for the beacon alone, posted the round once that block was 6 deep, and node 1 refused it - rightly: "there is
// no publication transaction to read" before the beacon - and the runner exited.
//
// So, on a chain nobody here mines, the runner now waits for ITS OWN PUBLICATION first:
//   - while the publication is unconfirmed, no beacon is named and nothing is posted; each new block that comes without
//     it raises its fee (the wallet's bumpfee: the same outputs at a higher rate), so it does not sit for hours;
//   - once it has confirmed, the beacon is named - and only a beacon strictly ABOVE the publication's block counts;
//   - a round whose beacon block came first - no publication below it, or one at or above it: the fcb15cca shape - is
//     NOT a published round. It is never posted or forced through; the caller drafts a new round and publishes that.
