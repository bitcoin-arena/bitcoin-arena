// A FEDERATION'S RESERVE KEY, KEPT WITH THE EPOCH IT BELONGS TO (kanban #803, measured 2026-10-30 07:3xZ on round e994c3c4, federation B):
// four of the five seated seats verified the entry's reserve output to 02efa760…, and Mac seat 5 refused it, "the output … is not 2000
// msat to key 02ef0576…". Its GET /reserves showed both: `key` 02efa760… (its own share for the current guardian seats, epoch
// 296aff8c) and `reserveKey` 02ef0576… - the key it had kept for the federation from an earlier set of guardian seats, kept for good,
// whatever the members became. A kept key now answers only for the epoch it was kept under; a federation whose epoch moved is read anew.

/**
 * The seat's kept reserve keys. `get(fed)`, `keys()` and `values()` read as the Map they replace (a key whatever its epoch, for a reader
 * with no census at hand); `getFor(fed, epoch)` answers only a key kept under that epoch; `setFor` keeps one with its epoch;
 * `dropMoved(epochOf)` lets go of every key whose federation's epoch is now another (`epochOf(fed)`: the current epoch, or null when
 * this seat cannot tell, which keeps the key).
