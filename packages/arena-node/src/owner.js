// THE NODE'S OWNER (kanban #276, Daniel 2026-10-09: "Under Node /Dashboard, a separate owner area. The owner must
// authenticate. First time: 24 Bitcoin words for restore, stored in local storage").
//
// The owner is a key, not an account. The browser makes 32 random bytes, shows them as 24 BIP-39 words to write down,
// keeps them in its local storage, and derives the owner key from them (`ownerSecretFromSeed`); the same words in any
// other browser are the same owner. The node keeps only the owner's public key (a JSON file beside its database).
//
// NO SESSION, NO COOKIE, as everywhere on this daemon: every owner request carries its own BIP-340 signature over a
// tagged hash of [node key, action, arguments, time] (`ownerMessage`). The node key in it means a request signed for one
// node does nothing at another; the time and the kept signatures mean a request cannot be sent twice.
//
// WHO MAY BECOME THE OWNER: whoever holds the node's claim code. A node with no owner makes one at start, prints it in
// its log and writes it beside its database (readable by its operator only); the first signed claim with that code binds
// the owner and the code is gone. Nobody reaching the public address can claim a node without access to its machine.
//
// This file is shared: the node checks with it, and the owner page signs with it (bundled into pages/owner-client.js).
