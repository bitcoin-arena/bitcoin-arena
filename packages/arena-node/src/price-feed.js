// THE COMMITTEE'S PRICE FEED (§11, kanban #311): "the committee nodes publish one attested sample every 5 s of round time
// from the contract's named feed - and, with the first, the 64 samples before start_time from the feed's history ... The
// player never chooses the price; he can only replay it or not play."
//
//   READ. Every seat reads the feed itself every 5 s, on the wall clock's 5 s grid, and keeps its own readings (the last 128).
//   LEAD. Sample k of a round (applied at round time k x 5 s) is led by the round's seat k mod n, as an order batch is - ONE
//         PERIOD AHEAD: it takes its own reading at round time (k - 1) x 5 s, signs the sample (round, tick, price) and asks
//         every other seat (POST /price-sign), so the attested sample is at the player's page before the run reaches its
//         tick (measured need: a sample signed at its own moment reached the page 1-2 s after the tick it names).
//   SIGN. A seat signs only a sample of a round it holds, whose moment is now (within SIGN_SLACK_MS), at the tick that moment
//         names, and whose price is within `tolerance` of its OWN reading at that moment - so no seat can pick the price,
//         only report one the others saw too. It signs one price per (round, k): a second, different ask is refused.
//   HOLD. With the threshold of the committee's signatures (receiptsNeeded) the leader hands the attested sample to every
//         seat (POST /price-attested); each checks it stands before keeping it. GET /price-samples serves what a seat holds.
//   THE TAPE. The 64 prices before the start are one PriceTape, led by the round's seat 0 at the start: its readings on the
//         grid before the start; a seat signs it when every reading it holds for those moments is within tolerance and it
//         holds at least half of them.
//   THE ENDS. A round's result is made from two samples only: sample 0 (its open) and the last sample at or before its last tick
//         (its close, closeSampleK). Every seat that keeps one of them also writes it to its database, so a restart keeps it; a
//         seat that lacks one at the end asks the committee for it (GET /price-samples?ks=) and keeps it once it stands
//         (measured on testnet4 2026-10-14, kanban #312: the samples lived in memory only, every seat of a 6 h Tick Tock round
//         had restarted during it, and each held a different first sample - 2151, 2175, 2190 ... - so no two would have signed
//         the same open).
// What a client does with them (the batch carries each attested sample at its tick; a run with none is SIM) is slice 2.
//
// PROTOCOL 5 - THE MEDIAN OF SIGNED READINGS (kanban #312, RULED Daniel 2026-10-14 ~21:50Z: "Build A as protocol 5 ... each seat
// signs the price it read, and the sample is the median of five signed readings. Nobody proposes a price, so nobody chooses
// BULLS, BEARS, or FLAT."). For a round whose OWN version is 5 or later (constants.js mediansPrices) - a round below keeps all
// of the above unchanged:
//   READ. As above, with the interim's rules for each seat's own reading: the exchange ticker, at most 5 s old, else none.
//   POST. Every seat of the committee - no leader - signs ITS OWN reading of sample k at round time (k - 1) x 5 s (one period
//         ahead, as above) and posts it to the committee's other seats (POST /price-reading); one reading a seat a sample,
//         and only at its moment. The tape: each seat signs its own 64 readings before the start once, a period before it.
//   HOLD. Every seat keeps every reading that is signed by a key of the round's committee and verifies (a key that signed two
//         different readings of one sample counts for none of them); a sample stands with `needed` (5 of 7) distinct readings,
//         its price their median (price-sample.js priceSampleStands5). GET /price-samples serves each standing sample with its
//         readings once all the committee's are in or SERVE_AFTER_MS has passed since its moment, so the pages take the same
//         set; `ks` serves every reading held of those samples.
//   THE ENDS. The readings of sample 0 and of the closing sample are written to the database as they come; at the end a seat
//         that holds fewer than the whole committee's asks the others (GET /price-samples?ks=) and takes every reading that
//         verifies, so the seats sign the result over the same readings (round-result.js roundResultFromReadings).
