// TRANSCRIPTS LEAVE WITH THEIR CLAIM WINDOW (§34, kanban #33 step 4; Daniel 2026-10-17: "Transcripts are deleted when the claim window
// ends, as §34 reads - not kept longer"). §34: "transcripts must be retained through the objection and claim windows by all seven
// nodes". Measured 2026-10-18 on seat 1: 447,137 tick rows (43.7 MB), 66,501 batches (25.0 MB) and 4,498 checkpoints (1.7 MB) over
// 246 rounds, none ever deleted.
//
// A round's transcript - its `ticks`, `batches` and `checkpoints` - is kept until the latest of its entry close and its close on this
// seat, plus its objection window W, plus its contract's claim_window_days; after that it is deleted. A contract that names no claim
// window (no rules block) keeps its transcript: there is no window to end. The round itself, its entries, receipts and results stay.
