// The node's two doors.
//
// HTTP for the things that happen once - open a round, read it, take an entry
// - and a WebSocket for the thing that happens all round: input batches, and
// the close that ends them. That split is not decoration: a batch arrives
// sixty times a second and a round opens once, and putting both through the
// same door would mean a handshake per tick.
//
// Bodies are the protocol's own bytes, not JSON of them. The contract that
// crosses the wire is the contract that is hashed, so a node cannot
// accidentally store something that encodes differently from what it was
// given. `application/octet-stream` throughout.
//
// One process, one player, no verification. There is no bond here, no quota
// and no committee; those are M2.1 steps 4 and later, and each is refused
// rather than half-built.

   * in both orders: the first daemon to close answered 126-171 ms before the
   * other signer node had stored that run's result, so it was left at "1 of 2 agree"
   * and its payout table at "1 of 2 signer nodes signed", and nothing asked again.
   *
   * So after a close, every stored run that is not final is gathered again from
   * the round's peers every `everyMs` - results, the same pull as the close's -
   * and while the payout table is short the round's close logic runs again
   * too. When a run turns final, THIS ROUND'S OWN CLOSE LOGIC runs again:
   * settle and cancel (a hold that moved is left alone), then the table's
   * gather and queue (a row that moved on is kept). It stops when nothing is
   * short, or when the round's objection window has passed, and says which.
   *
   * A SETTLE THAT FOUND NO PREIMAGE IS SHORT TOO (M3.3-29). Measured on the
   * rehearsal, 6 of 21: the second daemon to close was final at its own close,
   * settled, and asked the first for its share while the first was still short
   * - "no share is handed out before the result is final" - so it wrote HELD,
   * and this watch stopped, having nothing short, while lnd settled the stake
   * through the first. A final run whose settle is still HELD is now asked
   * again on the same cadence, inside the same window; the settle asks for the
   * shares again, and a hold that moved meanwhile is left alone.
   *
   * AND A RUN INSIDE ITS OBJECTION WINDOW IS WAITING (M3.3-32). The close
   * settles nothing on a PROVISIONALLY_FINAL run, so this watch keeps going
   * until that run's window has closed, then runs the close logic again - and

   * settle short of shares still has as long to ask as it had before.
