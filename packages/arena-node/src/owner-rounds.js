//
//   not in the census     its bond does not count yet (unconfirmed, not matured, or stepped out with serving = false)
//   no round role         "Play and check rounds" and "Pay out winners" are both off
//   no game announced     its announcement names none of the games the recent rounds are for (the 2026-10-27 case: the seats loaded
//                         Up/Down v24 and never announced it, so no v24 round drew them)
//   not drawn             it is in every draw it can be in, and the lottery picked others - with its share of the bonds as the odds
//   no rounds             no round was posted in the last day
//   no rounds held        this node holds no round at all (kanban #757): it has not fetched the network's series yet
//
// Pure: the seat hands in the rows and the census row (server.js, GET /owner/rounds).
