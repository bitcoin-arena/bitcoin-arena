// A PICTURE OF SOMEBODY ELSE'S TRUCK, BUILT FROM WHAT THEY PUBLISHED.
//
// 0.9 lets a player watch competitors "drive, struggle, fail and arrive", and
// 0.10 says what that must not become: another player's truck is a PICTURE,
// never an input to my simulation. The frame itself was already in
// `arena-protocol/src/ghost.js` and nothing produced one - so the question this file
// answers is the one that decides whether ghosts are honest at all: where do
// the three numbers come from?
//
// They come from the run the other player published, replayed through
// `replay.js`, which is the daemon's only door to the simulator. Not from a
// position a node announces, not from a second stepping loop here, and not
// from a renderer: a node that made up coordinates would be painting a
// competitor somewhere they never were, which is the same fault a payout table
// had before `payoutInputsId`.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE TOUCHES THE CORE. It asks `replay` for a picture and
// builds a frame around it, so the guard that counts the files reaching the
// simulator still counts one.
