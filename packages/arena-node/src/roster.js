// start of this slice: not one file under any `src/` called `scanCensus`,
// `resolveCensus`, `deriveCensus` or `commitCensus`, so a node could serve
// rounds without ever asking Bitcoin who was bonded - the census was a thing
// the tests did.
//
// This is the caller, and it is the ONLY one. Eligibility is not re-decided
// here: this fetches a chain view, hands it to `deriveCensus` with the curve
// the census needs, and hands what comes back to `selectCommittee`. Every rule
// - the marker, the template, the floor, the roles, the version, spentness,
// depth, and the network's minimum census - lives where it already lived. A
// second implementation of any of them here is exactly the divergence 5A.2
// exists to prevent, and the guard test in `round.test.js` counts the files
// that reach the census the same way it counts the files that reach the core.
