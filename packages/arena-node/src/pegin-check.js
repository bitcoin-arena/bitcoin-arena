// A PEG-IN IS CHECKED AGAINST THE RUNNING FEDERATION BEFORE ITS CONFIRMATIONS ARE WAITED OUT (Daniel 2026-09-29 12:25,
// PEGIN-WATCH-1225).
//
// What happened: gateway B's client still held an older config under the same federation id 337ae01a - peer 0 key
// 0383be7e, finality 2, a peg-in descriptor 02d3691c - because a Fedimint client refuses a key change under one id
// ("Global configuration changes are not allowed"). It derived tb1q05fn, 9d68228c paid it, and the watcher read only
// the balance: 0 msat for 60 blocks, reported as maturing, while the running federation (027acbea, finality 100,
// 03d0720e) could never see that deposit. Named only after 100 confirmations.
//
// The rule, applied before any waiting: the gateway's config for the federation has the running federation's guardian
// keys, finality and peg-in descriptor, and the gateway's current client derived the paid address. Either failing is a
// MISMATCH now - it names both key prefixes and both addresses - and is never "waiting". Only a peg-in that passes both
// waits for its credit.
