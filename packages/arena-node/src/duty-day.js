 * THE DAY'S DUTY, ONE ENGINE FOR THE NODE AND THE RUNNER (kanban #702, 2026-10-26: "The round runners must be an integrated part of the
 * node. Who decides what round is posted today? There is something in the spec"). What tools/run-testnet4-paid.mjs PAID_DUTY_DAILY did,
 * lifted out with everything it read handed in: the node's own duty poster (duty-poster.js) runs it on its own chain, census, wallet and
 * seats; the runner keeps working by calling the same code until the six runner processes are retired.
 *
 *   WHO       day d's duty (duty.js): the census at the day's anchor in duty order, H(duty tag || network_id || d || node key); the first
 *             is due from the day's start, each next one an hour later while the day's marker is not seen - capped at rank
 *             DUTY_DAY_RANK_CAP (duty-guard.js), so nodes that post nothing cannot push the post towards the evening
 *   WHAT      ONE transaction per app: the next UTC day's rounds in every federation, the newest version the census can draw, the day's
 *             marker OP_RETURN "ARN" 'D' day item beside the series publications, announced to the seats at once (POST /expected), the
 *             series posted to them once the publication is in a block (POST /series)
 *   AFTER     (kanban #689) every posting judged each look - publication below its beacon, its census on the chain the seats follow,
 *             the beacon 6 deep, the committee drawn on the seats - and a day that is dead, or not drawable 4 h before it starts, gets an
 *             emergency grid of what is left of it, carrying its own marker
 *   REORGS    (2026-10-26, the owner: "The hardened round poster must also check for reorgs and forks and repost automatically as needed.
 *             We may never be without a valid round on a day"): a posting whose census block the chain left, or whose census the seats'
 *             chains do not hold, is dead; one dropped back to the mempool by a reorg is watched again, its fee raised near its committee
 *             time, dead once its beacon passes it unconfirmed; one whose coins a mined transaction spends (conflicted) is dead at once -
 *             and a dead day is posted again, at once, as an emergency grid covering from as soon as it can start
 *
 * Nothing here exits the process: a seat that does not answer, a chain read that fails, a grid that is refused - each is said and the next
 * look (a minute later) tries again.
