// WHO ASKS FOR A ROUND'S SETTLEMENT, AND THE STATES AN OLD POOL PAYOUT WAS RECORDED IN.
//
// This file was the on-chain pool payout - a committee pool output, its signed payout table (§20), a FROST spend
// broadcast by one asker, PAYOUT_QUEUED -> PAID - and that payout only ever ran after the hold invoice's settle. It is
// deleted with the custody it served (§23.6, RULED Daniel 2026-09-22 22:59; this cut RULED 2026-09-25): a round's
// winners are paid by its lock settlement. What is left is what the lock settlement reads - the asker, chosen from the
// round itself, and when another signer node takes over - and the four state words, which a store from before keeps.

/**
 * WHICH SIGNER NODE ASKS FOR A ROUND'S PAYOUT, AND IT IS EXACTLY ONE.
 *
 * A round's settlement has one asker (settlement.js): it builds the one transaction, collects five nonce
 * commitments and five shares, aggregates them and submits. (It was written for the on-chain pool payout's
 * `payWithCommittee`, deleted with the withdrawn custody; the rule is the lock settlement's now.) Every signer node on
 * the committee closes the round, so if every signer node asked, five of them would
 * run five signing rounds over ONE output. FROST aggregates over the nonces
 * that were committed, so those five are five DIFFERENT transactions spending
 * the same input: one confirms and four are double-spends the chain refuses -
 * and every signer node can only hold one live nonce pair per round, so in practice
 * the five askers deadlock each other instead.
 *
 * So the asker is chosen from the round itself, the way everything else here
 * is: the signer nodes in the order the store keeps them - by pubkey, which no signer node
 * chooses - indexed by the round id. No message, no election, no clock, and
 * every signer node computes the same answer from facts it already holds.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO is hand the round to somebody else when the asker is
 * down. That needs a clock and a rule for how long to wait, and inventing one
 * here would be inventing the protocol. The round stays PAYOUT_QUEUED, which
 * is a state an operator can see, and it is its own line on the list.

 * not there to let a transaction confirm. It is there so two signer nodes do not

 * can grind: to move up the order it would have to change the round id, and

/**
 * WHICH SIGNER NODES MAY ASK AT THIS BLOCK HEIGHT, AND WHEN THE NEXT ONE MAY.
 *
 * ITEM 19. The asker is picked from the round id, so a signer node that is offline
 * when its round closes leaves the payout at PAYOUT_QUEUED with the other six
 * correctly waiting - and a signer node that never comes back strands the round for
 * ever. Somebody has to be allowed to take over, and the question that decides
 * the shape is what they take over WITH.
 *
 * THE CLOCK IS THE ROUND'S OWN BEACON HEIGHT, which is not a new time source:
 * a round that has no randomness beacon cannot be seeded and cannot be played,
 * so every signer node already holds this number and holds the same one. Wall clocks
 * are per-node - two signer nodes a minute apart would both take over - and the
 * pool output's own confirmations are the wrong anchor, because a pool funded
 * long before the round closes is already deep and every signer node would be
 * eligible at once.
 *
 * Signer node k in the order above may ask once the chain has advanced
 * `k * TAKEOVER_BLOCKS` past the beacon. The round's own asker is k = 0 and is
 * therefore uniquely eligible the moment the round closes.
 *
 * SEVERAL SIGNER NODES ELIGIBLE AT ONCE IS NORMAL AND HARMLESS, and it is worth
 * saying because it looks like the fault. After a long outage the chain is far
 * past the beacon and most of the ring may ask. They do not compete: every
 * signer node's nonce pair is on disk, so a second asker collects the SAME
 * commitments and rebuilds the transaction byte for byte. Measured - before
 * the pair was durable, a restarted committee signed the same spend with
 * different signature bytes; now it is identical.
