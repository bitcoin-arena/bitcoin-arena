// LEAVE WITHOUT BEING SLASHED (kanban #276 step 2, Daniel 2026-10-09: "Leave rounds, attestations, and custody without being
// slashed"). What the protocol slashes: a false or double signature, and a fee claimed for service not given (slash.js); a
// node absent from a round is not slashed ("a node that took nothing has cost nobody anything"). So a seat leaves by taking
// no new round from the moment its owner says so and serving every round it already holds to the end: past its end and its
// objection window, and - a paying round with entries - until its settlement is accepted. This answers what is still owed
// and from when the seat is free. Custody: a guardian may go only if the federation keeps its threshold without it
// (federation-slash.js haltsAt: f + 1 gone halts it, and a halt is what a guardian's bond answers for).
