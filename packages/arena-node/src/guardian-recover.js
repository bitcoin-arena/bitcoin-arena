// A GUARDIAN BACK FROM A RAM SNAPSHOT AFTER AN UNCLEAN STOP, CHECKED BEFORE IT STARTS (kanban #718, 2026-10-26: "this recovery process must
// be hardened and run whenever fedimints in RAM disk are not properly shut down and runs automatically on startup to recover").
//
// MEASURED: the Beelink rebooted at 13:31Z inside federation A's session 7753. Its 7 guardians (all of the federation, one machine) came
// back from snapshots taken one after another over the minute; each had lost a different stretch of its own AlephBFT units, re-made those
// rounds differently, and the session never closed (~7 h). The manual repair (ops/fedA-repair-7753.sh): session_status equal on all 7
// (the same 28 accepted items), all 7 stopped, their RAM databases backed up, the AlephBFT units (RocksDB key prefix 0x05) AND the unfinished
// session's accepted items (0x01) deleted, all 7 started together. Without 0x01 deleted the fresh ordering processed 0 of the 28 and the
// session end asserted processed == stored (engine.rs:600, "left: 0, right: 28", a panic).
//
// FEDIMINT 0.12 (fedimint-server src/db.rs, consensus/db.rs, consensus/engine.rs of v0.12.1/0.12.2 and the fork, read for this):
//   0x01 AcceptedItemKey(item index)       this session's accepted items; written in the same transaction as the item's effect
//   0x04 SignedSessionOutcomeKey(session)  one per finished session; the count = the highest index + 1 (get_finished_session_count)
//   0x05 AlephUnitsKey(n)                  this session's AlephBFT backup; any present = a recovery (is_recovery)
//   complete_session drops 0x05 and 0x01 together and writes 0x04. Keys are the prefix byte + the index as a BigSize (fedimint encoding).
//   A guardian behind its federation takes a closed session's signed outcome from its peers and asserts that its own accepted items are
//   that outcome's first items (engine.rs "pending accepted items disagree with federation consensus").
//   AlephBFT (fedimint-aleph-bft 0.36, default features off): no initial unit collection - a restarted member creates units from the round
//   after its own last saved one. A member that lost saved units therefore re-makes rounds its peers already hold: a FORK. AlephBFT
//   tolerates f = floor((n-1)/3) forkers; more, and the session cannot close - what federation A saw (7 forkers of 7).
//
// SO, FOR THE GUARDIANS OF ONE FEDERATION RESTORED UNCLEANLY IN THE SAME BOOT OF THIS MACHINE (k of its n):
//   clean stop            restored from the snapshot written after fedimintd exited (ramFinal): nothing lost, started as is
//   k = n, one set        all from the same snapshot set (guardian-ram.js: frozen together) - one moment of the whole federation, no
//                         unit any of them lacks: started as is
//   k = n, mixed          the accepted items (0x01) and finished sessions (0x04) compared on all k: equal - each RAM database kept on disk
//                         (ram-snaps/pre-repair-*), 0x05 and 0x01 deleted on all, all started together (the federation A repair, now
//                         automatic); different - REFUSED, none started, the reason in the log (the states are not one; no automatic
//                         choice of whose state wins)
//   k = n, mixed, in      (rehearsal 2026-10-28 B: 4 guardians at 7 finished, 2 at 8, 1 at 9 - snapshots of a running federation are a
//   different sessions    session or two apart.) The guardians at the highest count (the TOP) hold the signed outcome of every session
//                         below it, so those sessions are closed: the ones BEHIND take them from the top by fedimint's catch-up, which
//                         asserts their accepted items are the outcome's first items. Checked first, per session: the accepted items of
//                         the guardians at one count must be prefixes of each other (one ordering seen at different moments); items that
//                         differ in the same session - REFUSED, none started. The top's session is the open one, its units lost in
//                         different stretches on all: the top's items must be equal, and are repaired as above (0x05 + 0x01 deleted, each
//                         kept first). The ones behind are not touched and take the lone path: each waits until a peer (the top, started
//                         at once) is past its session - so the closed session is taken from the top, not ordered again among them
//   k <= f                a LONE guardian (or a few) whose peers elsewhere ran on: it waits, before fedimintd starts, until a peer's
//                         session count is past the session it was in. That session is then closed - its saved units are of a session no
//                         peer runs any more, so nothing it makes can fork - and fedimint's own catch-up takes the signed outcome, its
//                         accepted items (all from before the snapshot, so the outcome's first items) asserted to agree. Nothing deleted.
//                         No peer past it within the wait (the federation stalled): started anyway, as stock fedimint would, and said so
//   f < k < n             REFUSED: more guardians out of step than the federation tolerates, and not all of them, so no repair on this
//                         machine alone makes them one; the log says to stop all n and repair them together
// The nodes of one machine are separate processes: each restored guardian registers in <RAM base>/recover/<federation>/, waits up to
// `gatherMs` for the others, and the first to take the decide lock decides for all registered and writes the verdict; each reads its own.
// A VERDICT BELONGS TO ONE CRASH (rehearsal 2026-10-28, phase C): a guardian restored again minutes after its group's verdict, while that
// group runs, is not part of that group. Only the guardians that are down and restoring NOW form a group. A late guardian joins the old
// verdict only when its database is the group's moment (the same set, or the repaired group's session and items). Otherwise, when its
// peers run (one announced on this machine since the verdict with a live fedimintd, or answering its API), it is decided afresh among
// the guardians restoring now; alone, that is the lone path. When the whole old group restores again (a second crash), it is decided afresh.
