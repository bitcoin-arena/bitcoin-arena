// A SEAT'S PART IN A FOUNDING (spec §23A.2): when to start one and how its own guardian takes part. founding.js runs
// the ceremony; this reads its inputs off what the seat holds and drives the node's own guardian.
//
//   TRIGGER   foundingTrigger over what this seat holds: a record that entered DRAINING (succession) at its height; the first height
//             with federation_nominal guardian-capable operators while no federation exists (genesis); every OPEN federation at 80 %
//             of its cap for abandon_blocks (load). The seat keeps the census and load history it saw at each tick.
//   SEED      the beacon: the hash of the block after trigger_height, once it is in the seat's chain.
//   CENSUS    the bonded census at trigger_height, its entries with their adverts (guardian_capable, guardian_endpoint).
//   GUARDIAN  a node takes part only while one of its guardians waits in Fedimint's setup (its setup status is not
//             ConsensusIsRunning): its own guardian (a node with no ceremony files starts it in setup mode with
//             ARENA_FOUNDING=1, node-start.js), else its second one, the guardian-next (a guardian in consensus
//             seated first in its federation's successor takes part through a second fedimintd in setup mode beside it).
//             Its setup calls go through fedimint-cli's `admin setup` against that guardian's own API socket, with its admin
//             password.
//   NOTICE    a succession is also triggered by a standing departure notice (§23A.6 "or a departure notice that would make it
//             DRAINING"): the seat's held notices (absences.js, POST /departure) against the held record of an OPEN
//             federation - or one already DRAINING or CRITICAL - whose seated guardians without the leaving one fall to DRAINING
//             (CRITICAL at four, §23A.1); trigger_height is the height the notice was posted at.
//   SEATED    a succession seats the record's seated, non-departing guardians first, in the record's order (node key
//   FIRST     ascending), and draws the missing seats (drawGuardians). The draw's pool leaves out the operators guarding an OPEN
//             federation other than the one succeeded (their census adverts' guardian_of[] naming a federation whose held record is
//             OPEN), and the leaving guardians' operators (the succeeded federation's departing / gone guardians).
