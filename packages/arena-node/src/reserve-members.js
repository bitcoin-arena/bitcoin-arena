// A FEDERATION'S RESERVE SEATS FROM THE CENSUS (§27A.9.2, kanban #397): every census entry whose advertisement names the federation
// in guardian_of - ONE SEAT PER NODE KEY. Measured 2026-10-22 03:4xZ: Beelink seat 1 (2fca1090) holds two bonds since a bond was added
// from the owner page (#553), so the census carries it twice, both naming federation A; A's reserve committee listed it twice (8, not
// 7), the reserve epoch refused "two signer nodes of that committee are one key", A never got a reserve key, and GET /reserves
// answered 400 on all 14 seats.
