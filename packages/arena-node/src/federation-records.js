// The body is built from what every seat of a series reads the same: the census of the newest round it holds (the
// census nodes whose bond advertisements name the federation in guardian_of[]), at that round's census height - so seats
// on one series build byte-identical bodies and their signatures add up. A guardian is GONE when its own node says it is
// leaving (the owner's leave, owner-leave.js), signed with the node key beside its record signature. ABANDONED - 2f + 1
// absence attestations for abandon_blocks - needs each guardian's per-peer consensus view from the federation client and
// is not counted yet; the record says nothing it cannot back.
//
// A seat that is a guardian signs the body (GET /federation-record); every seat gathers the guardians' signatures from
// their endpoints and, at the threshold, keeps the signed record and mirrors it at GET /federations. A record whose status
// is DRAINING, CRITICAL or CLOSED makes the federation draining at this seat (no new round names it).
