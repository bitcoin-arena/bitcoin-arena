# KEEP OUR TESTNET4 NODES ON THE PUBLIC CHAIN (kanban #577, 2026-10-23): our miners B and C win a difficulty-1 block now and then but
# lose the tie to the public one by milliseconds; the node that took ours first stays on it (equal work, first seen), and its seats
# read a census the rest of the network does not have. Every 20 s, for the Beelink node and the MacBook node:
#
#   INVALIDATE  when mempool.space holds a block at our tip's height that is not ours, and the public chain is at least SETTLE blocks
#               past that height, ours is invalidated (logged). A block of ours ahead of the public tip is never touched.
#   RECONSIDER  every block this guard invalidated that mempool.space now holds at its height is reconsidered on that node.
#
# Measured 2026-10-23 05:30-06:51Z: height 157,361 reorged publicly (fa1ff884 -> c88eb72b -> fa1ff884). The first guard invalidated
# whatever was not public at that moment and could not take it back, so both nodes stood still at 157,360 for 80 minutes; the seats
# fell behind and federation B's session 4659 could not close until the blocks were reconsidered by hand. SETTLE waits out a short
# public reorg; RECONSIDER undoes any invalidation the public chain disagrees with afterwards.
