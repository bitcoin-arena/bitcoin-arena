# RUN A COMMAND WITH THIS HOST'S FUNNEL NAME RESOLVED TO ITS OWN TAILNET ADDRESS. The public Funnel relay drops a TLS
# handshake that starts on this same host (measured 2026-09-27 08:25: "unexpected eof", 0 bytes read, on every path,
# the Daily's /blwp-a too), while the tailnet serve on 100.x answers the same name with the same certificate. So a
# client on this host - the lock client, fedimint-cli, a gateway, a guardian asking its peers - reaches the four
# guardians' public wss addresses through a private /etc/hosts in its own user and mount namespace; nothing else on
# the host is changed.
