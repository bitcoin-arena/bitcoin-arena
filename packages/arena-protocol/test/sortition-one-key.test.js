// ONE NODE KEY, ONE SEAT (RULED Daniel 2026-09-30, after testnet4 round 5eaa0966). A census still holding extra bond rows
// under some node keys seated node 7 and node 4 twice (game) and node 2 twice (settlement); the stake's handout could not
// be dealt. Now a key is drawn at most once, all its bonds one entry: its sats summed into its weight, its ticket drawn on
// its lowest outpoint. MEASURED BEFORE (the per-row draw, reproduced below on the same census): duplicates on most seeds.
