// LATE JOIN: A RUN BEGINS WHERE THE ENTRY SAYS IT JOINED.
//
// 0.8: "A round supports a dynamically growing number of competitors... Late
// join is a normal feature, not merely reconnect. Each accepted entrant
// receives the same contract-defined mission duration `T_run`, even when
// wall-clock start times differ."
//
// Section 1: "All accepted players belong to the same logical round and payout
// pool. Every player receives the same mission duration `T_run`. Late join is
// normal." Section 7: "Late joins simply add more Entry Contracts. The Round
// Contract is never rewritten."
//
// So there is nothing to catch up to - 0.10 gives every player a private world
// and a late entrant's begins at their own tick. What CAN go wrong is the
// transcript claiming to begin somewhere else.
//
// Measured before this file existed: an entry that joined at tick 50 had its
// transcript accepted beginning at 0, at 50 and at 500 - all three - because
// `checkTranscript` is handed a transcript and never the entry it is for.
