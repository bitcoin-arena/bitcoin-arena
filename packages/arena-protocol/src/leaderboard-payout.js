// A LEADERBOARD PAYOUT REQUEST (kanban #460, Daniel 2026-10-17: "new proposal type, not a withdrawal but re-assign to the federation when
// a specific protocol version is active ... Example: distribution of X sats for the best 10 p&l of last week ... Which game/market/all
// global and the top count. Amount is divided equally or configurable. Time period is last 7 days, last 14 days, last month. Payment
// date is another field ... Same protections apply as it only returns it to the federation and pays out top users ... Voting is 2 weeks,
// no signal period. This is a leaderboard payout request not a pip"; "25% but with weight"; 2026-10-18: "YES >= 25 % of the voting
// weight is enough on its own. Do not also require more YES than NO").
//
//     LeaderboardPayout { network_id, author, published_height, scope, game_name, top, amount_sats, federation_id, split_bps[],
//                         period_days, payment_height, purpose }      signed by its author, anyone; protocol version 12 (2026.0.12)
//
// THE VOTE: the funding proposals' bond-weighted count (funding.js fundingTally over voteWeights), from its publication for 2 weeks -
// no signal period. THE ONLY PASS TEST: YES weight >= 25 % of the voting weight (everyone who could vote). A larger NO does not block
// it; ABSTAIN is not YES; there is no second majority test.
//
// THE PAYOUT, at the payment height: the network season of its scope over [payment time - period, payment time) - the top N by P&L,
// identities only (a player whose entries name a round key that is the player itself is no identity, badges.js's rule: skipped, the
// next one moves up); a tie at the cut shares the places it spans; each winner paid a payout contract to its identity's refund key in
// the federation, from that federation's protocol reserves - at most 10 % of them (funding.js FUNDING_CAP_PCT).
