// WHAT EACH OUTCOME DOES TO ITS STAKE LOCK, AND WHAT IT TAKES TO DO IT (§23.1, §23.2 - the federation's custody, the one
// this network has: §23.6, RULED Daniel 2026-09-22 22:59).
//
// A player's stake is a lock in the round's federation: LNv2's OutgoingContract, claimed by the preimage and the claim
// key, forfeited by the claim key to the refund key, refunded after its expiry by the refund key alone. So a lock has
// three ends, and each outcome sends it to one of them:
//
//   CLAIM    a loser's lock (FAILED, FORFEIT, a DELIVERED run below the score does not lose it) is claimed into the
//            round's settlement: the preimage (five of seven shares, §23.4) and the claim key's signature. The only
//            end that takes money from a player, and the only one with five conditions on it.
//   RETURN   a qualifier's own lock is forfeited back to its refund key (forfeit.js, W5b) on 5-of-7 settlement
//            signatures - returning a stake can only return it to its owner.
//   EXPIRE   a VOID: nobody acts, and the lock refunds at its expiry. "The default path - nobody acting - is always the
//            refund. That is what makes infrastructure failure safe."
//
// CUT 6b (RULED 2026-09-24) moved this here from payout.js, where it was written for a hold invoice - SETTLE, CANCEL,
// NOTHING - and deleted that vocabulary. The rule, its conditions, its order on the wire and the pool arithmetic are the
// same; only the names are the lock's. LOCK_ACTIONS keeps the byte order the settlement record (slash.js) was encoded in.
