//
// A node drawn up to 72 h ahead may be offline when its round comes, so each role draws more nodes than it seats
// (sortition.js drawCommittee: 9 for 7 seats) and seats the ones that show up:
//
//   present = drawn nodes that signed PRESENT(round_id, role, node_pubkey) before seating_close = start_time - 120 s
//   seated  = the first min(slots, |present|) present nodes in score order
//   a round opens for entries iff |seated| >= threshold
//
// The seated nodes sign SEATING(round_id, role, seated list); a seating is valid only with the signature of EVERY node it
// seats, and each node signs at most one seating per round and role that can still stand. Two valid seatings for one round
// and role always share a signer (2 x threshold > drawn), so two certificates are proof of equivocation by that signer: the
// round is void (§13C) and the signer's bond is slashable (§5A.3B).
//
// A SECOND SIGNATURE ONLY AFTER A MEMBER OF THE FIRST SIGNED ANOTHER (kanban #738, measured 2026-10-27 23:30Z: one overloaded seat
// signed the seating of 5 it held at the close, six signed the seating of 7, and no certificate formed). Seatings are ordered: S
// comes before T when T seats at least as many and its i-th seated ranks no lower in the draw than S's i-th, for every i of S.
// A node that signed S, holding no certificate, signs S' only when a member of S other than itself signed a seating that does
// not come before S, S' is the seating of the PRESENTs it holds now and comes after S, it is in S', and another node signed S'
// already (arena-node seating-agent.js resign). An honest node's signatures then come one after another in that order, the
// seating it left never completes, and two certificates still prove equivocation only by a node that broke this rule.
//
// NO RULE MAY EVER SLASH AN HONEST SEAT (kanban #738, RULED 2026-10-28, protocol 22). A Byzantine member B of S signs T to kill
// S, lets an honest H move on to S', then signs S as well: if S and S' both complete, the two share H. So from 22 a second
// seating signature carries its justification - B's signed seating T, which shows S can never stand (signed by a member of S,
// valid against the draw, not before S) - and a seating equivocation proof against a member is invalid where that member's
// second signature carries a valid justification. B is still caught: T and S are an equivocation of their own
// (seatingEquivocation `signedTwice`, seatingSignedTwice). Below 22 nothing carries one, byte for byte as before.
//
// A client enters a round only with a certificate it checked against the draw
// it computes itself (client-committee.js). The round contract is unchanged (2026-10-11, decision A): it names the
// round; who serves it is this certificate.
//
// FROM PROTOCOL 22 THE CERTIFICATE ALSO SAYS WHO WAS PRESENT (§5A.3, kanban #727, Daniel 2026-10-27). A node may be left out of a
// census as absent only with proof, and the proof is this certificate: besides its SEATING signature, every seated node signs a
// SEEN over that seating - every node it held a valid PRESENT of at the seating close (drawn, or one the round's census left out as
// absent coming back) and the nodes the round's census left out as absent. The certificate carries them after its signatures, one
// group per distinct list. A node is present at the seating if ANY seated node lists it, so to hide an honest node's PRESENT every
// seated node must lie. A PRESENT that reaches the seated after the close is in no list: for the proof that seating is missed. The
// SEATING body, its id and the equivocation rule are untouched, and a certificate below 22 carries no SEEN - byte for byte as before.

/**
 * TWO SEATINGS FOR ONE ROUND AND ROLE (§5A.7): each valid against the same draw, and different - proof of equivocation by
 * every node that signed both, but one whose signature on one of them carries a justification (kanban #738) that the other can
 * never stand: NO RULE MAY EVER SLASH AN HONEST SEAT. Its justification names the member that killed the other seating - in it,
 * so it signed that certificate - and that member's signature over a seating not before it: the two are an equivocation of their
 * own, against that member, unless its own justification (nested) shows the same seating could never stand, and so on down.
 * Answers `signers`, every node proved against (never empty while 2 x threshold > drawn); `excused`, the nodes a justification
 * clears; and `signedTwice`, the proofs from justifications - { node, certificate: 'a' | 'b' (the one it signed), seated,
 * signature (its signature over `seated`) }.
