// A ROUND THAT PAYS OUT NEEDS SOMEWHERE FOR THE MONEY TO COME IN.
//
// M3 (RULED Daniel 2026-09-20 11:09, named pick A): a paying round needs "inbound liquidity and >= 2
// independent gateways", and that means two LIVE testnet4 LND nodes that each have inbound - "same host is
// fine. No fake labelled gateways." (RULED 2026-09-20 19:xx, named pick (i): inbound on each of the two nodes
// from any peer, INCLUDING FROM EACH OTHER. Inbound from the public network is a later letter.)
//
// So what makes a gateway usable is not its label and not its host. It is three facts, and this counts them:
//
//   it is a SEPARATE NODE      a distinct identity pubkey, reached at its own rpc address. Two names on one
//                              node is one gateway wearing two hats, which is exactly the "fake labelled
//                              gateway" the ruling forbids. The HOST is not the test: both of ours run on the
//                              Beelink and that was allowed explicitly.
//   it is LIVE                 synced to its chain and holding at least one active channel. A node that is up
//                              but whose channels are all inactive cannot be paid; that is the state node A
//                              was found in, with 196530 sat of inbound it could not use because its only
//                              peer - our own node B - had been down since 2026-09-16.
//   it has INBOUND             remote_balance on its active channels, which is what somebody else can push to
//                              it. Outbound is the money it can send; inbound is the money it can RECEIVE,
//                              and a gateway that cannot receive is not a gateway.
//
// IT DECIDES NOTHING ABOUT THE GAME. This is custody, not the simulation: no outcome, no core state, nothing
// the client may recompute. It answers one question about the operator's own plumbing.
//
// MEASURED AGAINST THE REAL PAIR (testnet4, lnd 0.21.3-beta, 2026-09-20), after a real invoice was paid each
// way over channel dce6199b...:
//
//   beelink-testnet4    0274e261...  local 80000   inbound 116530   active, synced
//   beelink-testnet4-b  025f17c2...  local 116530  inbound  80000   active, synced
//
// The two payments that put it there: B -> A 100000 sat, preimage 7eb1b306...; A -> B 20000 sat, preimage
// 51f8782c... Both SUCCEEDED. Before them B had no inbound at all.
