// A RESULT NOBODY CAN REPLAY DOES NOT SETTLE (v4.6.2 §13A, P2).
//
// "A PROVISIONALLY_FINAL result is not FINAL until the canonical transcript it
// names by transcript_hash has been retrieved by >=5 settlement signer nodes from any
// game/verify node and posted by them to the round's publication_relays[], and
// the window W counts from that posting, not from the fifth signature."
// Without it a quorum that plays for itself sends the honest signer nodes nothing,
// signs what it likes, and nobody ever holds an object to replay.
//
// So there is one object: a signer node's word that it POSTED a run's transcript -
// round, player, the transcript's hash, and the signer node itself in the signed
// bytes. And one count: how many distinct ASSIGNED settlement signer nodes have said it
// about the same transcript, against the round's own threshold (2 of 2 on a
// test net, 5 of 7 otherwise), read off its settlement slots.
//
// A RELAY is any URL the contract names - "data, not infrastructure". What a
// signer node puts there is the transcript's bytes at `/transcript/<its hash>`, and
// the object verifies itself: a relay keeps bytes only under the hash they
// have, so a relay cannot serve one transcript under another's name.
//
// The curve is not this package's business: `verify(signature, digest, key)`
// is injected, as `claim-key.js` takes it.
