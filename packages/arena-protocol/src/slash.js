// 5A.3B: THE FRAUD PROOF, AND WHAT A SLASHING TRANSACTION MUST COMMIT TO.
//
// "A bond is forfeit on objectively provable misbehaviour, each a portable
// artifact anyone can check" (5A.3). The table there lists six offences; this
// file holds the one 13C names, which is the last of that section's four
// clauses: "nodes whose signature contradicts a replay of the canonical
// transcript are slashed".
//
// THE LAW IS NOT THE ENFORCEMENT, and only one of them is blocked. 5A.3B's
// five steps are: publish the proof, check it mechanically, sign a spend of
// path B with k-of-m arbitration keys, commit H(fraud_proof) in an OP_RETURN,
// pay the distribution. Steps 3 and 5 need an arbitration set, MuSig2 and a
// transaction - a daemon this repo does not have and will not pretend to.
// Steps 1, 2 and 4 need none of that: step 2 says every offence is "either a
// signature comparison or a deterministic replay. No judgement." That is a
// pure function, and it is what is here.
//
// THE REPLAY VERDICT IS INJECTED, exactly as 13A's objection injects it. This
// package steps no simulation and the daemon imports no core; whoever holds a
// replay says whether it differed, and this decides what follows from that.
// A missing verdict is NOT a slash: an accusation nobody has replayed is a
// claim, and a bond taken on a claim is the arbitration set's own offence.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE. The distribution - "half to the affected
// players of that round; the other half 75% to the active census nodes at the
// slashing height MINUS the round's own seats, and 25% to the developers
// members, as fixed by the Round Contract" - needs a contract field that does
// not exist yet, and adding one moves every round id. It is named and left.

 * round's own seats (the witnesses), and 25% to the donation set of §22A, as
 * fixed by the Round Contract."
 *
 * PURE, AND IT MOVES NOTHING. This says who is owed what out of a bond that
 * has been spent; spending it is 5A.3B steps 3 and 5, an arbitration set with
 * MuSig2 keys, and is not here.
 *
 * THE HALVES ARE THE SPEC'S AND THE DESTINATION IS THE CONTRACT'S. A contract
 * that could move the proportions would let an operator write itself the whole
 * bond, which is the fault a contract field exists to prevent rather than one
 * to import. So `SLASH_TO_PLAYERS_BPS` is a constant and `slashRemainder` is
 * the field, and it has one value: the split above.
 *
 * A SLASHED IDENTITY IN THE CENSUS IS REFUSED, NOT FILTERED. The second half
 * goes to the active census at the slashing height, and a slash SPENDS the bond
 * output, so `deriveCensus` has already dropped that node - a census still
 * listing it is wrong. Pass such a node in `slashed` and this THROWS. It is not
 * quietly removed and its share is not moved anywhere, because silently
 * patching the set would hide a census that is counting a spent bond.
 *
 * REMAINDERS the way this repo already does them: floor each share, then hand
 * the leftover out one satoshi at a time in ascending `H(roundId || pubkey)`,
 * the rule 22A names for fees and `payout.js` already uses for the pool. With
 * nobody to pay - no affected players, or a set entirely slashed - that half
 * goes to the FEDERATION POOL, 75% nodes and 25% developers, never burned.
