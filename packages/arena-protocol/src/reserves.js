// locks: the round split is mandatory; an item's developers' share is the player's choice of "40 30 20 10 0").
//
// Pure arithmetic, nothing paid yet: no live version speaks RESERVES_VERSION (it is not in SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS), and
// today's versions keep §0A.8's lowerable 5 % donation and #377's 50-0 % item share (donation.js, items.js, untouched).

// THE REMAINDER RULE (§27A.9.1): every share is floored to the msat; a round's net stake takes what the floors leave, so the
// parts always sum to the gross. An item's price is the sum of its parts.
