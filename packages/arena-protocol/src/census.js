 * 5A.4 STEP 1, SCAN: the chain says where an output was and whether it is

 *
 * "SCAN all outputs created at or before census_height whose script matches
 * the bond template (5A.3B) and that are unspent at census_height with >=
 * census_confirmations depth."
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES AND WHAT IT CANNOT. Three of those four conjuncts are read
 * off the blocks here: WHERE an outpoint was created, WHETHER it was spent at
 * or before the census height, and HOW DEEP it is. `commitCensus` applies all
 * three too - to fields the caller supplied. That is the difference: a
 * census used to be a bag of entries someone asserted heights and spends for,
 * and this derives both from the chain, so a publisher who lies about either
 * is caught by anyone holding the same blocks.
 *
 * THE FOURTH CONJUNCT IS NOT HERE AND IS NOT FAKED. Finding which outputs are
 * bonds at all needs `BOND_MARKER` - 25.1's single dust address that puts every
 * bond in the compact filters - and `BOND_MARKER` is `null` in this protocol
 * by a decision recorded in `constants.js`: it is a genesis parameter, fixed
 * once before the first bond exists, and writing a plausible address into a
 * source tree would settle it by accident. `bondMarker()` throws for exactly
 * that reason. So the candidate outpoints come IN - from the advertisements a
 * node already holds, which name `bondTxid` and `bondVout` - and enumerating
 * them from the chain alone waits on that parameter, not on a daemon.
 *
 * A BLOCK IS `{ height, transactions }`, transactions being raw bytes. Nothing
 * here fetches: the caller brings the blocks, and two callers holding the same
 * blocks get the same census or neither does.
 */

 * WHEN EACH OUTPOINT APPEARED AND WHETHER IT WAS SPENT, read off the blocks.

 * function of the chain up to census_height", so nothing after that height is

 * BODY -> EXCLUDED (identically for everyone: the hash is public, the content
 * is missing for all)."

 * body is missing for every participant, so excluding it keeps the census
 * canonical instead of making it depend on who could reach what. An entry

 * wait on nothing parked:
 *
 *   - the committed advertisement body is retrievable and hash-matching
 *   - `bond_amount >= bond_min(role)`, the floor the ROUND names: "bond_min
 *     (role) is named in the Round Contract, not global"
 *   - the advertisement declares the role and a supported protocol version
 *
 * THE OTHER THREE ARE NOT WORKED AROUND. The bond script template cannot be
 * read off a taproot output - 5A.3B is explicit that the paths nobody uses are
 * never revealed - which is the same wall `BOND_MARKER` stands behind. And the
 * advertisement signature needs a curve this package does not carry, exactly
 * as `provesEquivocation` needs one from its caller. Both are named in the
 * answer rather than silently passed.
 *
 * `resolve` is injected. It is handed an entry and returns the transaction
 * that funded it, or nothing: retrieval is a fetch, and this package fetches
 * nothing. A resolver that throws is a resolver that failed, and a body that
 * cannot be had is excluded rather than allowed to break the census.

 * derivation, they are parts - and the parts were reachable in the wrong
 * order. `scanCensus` handed back a root of its own with steps 2 and 3
 * unrun, so the shortest path through this package produced a census over
 * nodes whose advertisements nobody had read. That is the defect this closes:
 *
 *   1. SCAN     the blocks say where each candidate outpoint was created,
 *               whether it was spent by the census height, and how deep it is.
 *   2. RESOLVE  the committed advertisement body, retrieved and hash-matched.
 *   3. FILTER   5A.3's objective criteria, the three that wait on nothing.
 *   4. SORT     ascending by (funding_txid, vout), which cannot be ground.
 *   5. COMMIT   the tagged leaves, Merkle-rooted, promotion on an odd level.
 *
 * Steps 1 and 2-3 are still separately callable, because a node wants to know
 * WHY somebody was dropped and at which step. Neither of them returns a root.
 *
 * Every exclusion comes back, from either step, carrying the step that made it
 * and the reason. A census that quietly lost a bond and one that never had it
 * look identical from the root alone, and a node accused of publishing the
 * wrong census needs to be able to point at the rule that removed a name.
 *
 * The two 5A.3 criteria this cannot apply come back in `unchecked` as they do
 * from RESOLVE: the bond script template is unreadable until the output is
 * spent, and the advertisement signature needs a curve this package does not
 * carry. Neither is skipped quietly.
