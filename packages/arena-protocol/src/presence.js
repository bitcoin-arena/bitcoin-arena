// ONLY NODES SEEN IN THE LAST 24 H ARE DRAWN (multiplayer_p2p.md §5A.3 "Absent from its seatings", protocol 22, kanban #727).
//
// Measured on testnet4 2026-10-27: every Up/Down v23 round drew 9 nodes, 7-9 of them stopped test nodes whose bonds were still locked,
// so no round was seated all day. Daniel 14:00Z: "Können die adverts nur gezogen werden von nodes die in den letzten 24h auch online
// waren?" - yes, from 2.0. "Online" from pings is no shared fact, so the rule reads only threshold-signed seating certificates:
//
//   window      (T - 24 h, T], T the median time past of the census block
//   a seating   one (round, role) whose seating_close (seating.js) falls in the window and whose 22 certificate stands - every seated
//               node signed it and signed who it held a PRESENT of at the close (seating.js SEEN)
//   present     listed by any seated node of the certificate, or seated in it
//   missed      drawn for the seating by the round's own draw - or left out of the round's census as absent, as every seated node
//               says - and not present
//   absent      in the chain census, present at no window seating, and missed at ABSENCE_PROOF_SEATINGS (3) or more seatings or
//               heartbeat slots whose closes lie at least ABSENCE_PROOF_SPACING_MS (1 h) apart
//   census      from protocol 22 the census is the chain census less every output of an absent node; its root commits to that set
//
// ABSENCE ONLY WITH PROOF (Daniel 2026-10-27, "can it be manipulated which nodes are offline so others are chosen?"). As first built the
// posting node chose the absent from the PRESENTs it collected, and a seat could refuse it only with a signature it happened to hold: a
// posting node could leave out honest nodes to raise its own share of the draw. Now every absent node in a claim comes with three
// certificates the round's seated signed, and any seat and the client check them alone: the signers are the seated of the round's own
// draw, the node was drawn there (or left out already) and no seated node listed it. A claim without that is not a census at all.
// To hide an honest node's PRESENT every seated node of a seating must lie, three times at three moments.
//
// AND NOT FOR A FEW MISSED SEATINGS (Daniel 2026-10-27, an attacker flooding a node while it is drawn): fewer than 3 missed seatings,
// or present once, and the node is kept. 3 closes at least 1 h apart (ABSENCE_PROOF_SPACING_MS), so one blackout - on two games' grids,
// or a restart across several heartbeat slots - counts once.
//
// AND THE HEARTBEAT, SO A DAY IS ENOUGH (kanban #727, Daniel 2026-10-27): a seating proves only its 9 drawn missed, and only when 5 of
// them are present, so on 10-27 the stopped nodes took three days to be proven out. A heartbeat certificate (heartbeat.js) proves EVERY
// node of its round's census missed that it does not list, one slot per round (Daniel 2026-10-27). A proof names a seating (role game or
// settlement) or a heartbeat slot (role heartbeat-0); both count towards the 3 closes an hour apart, and a listing in either keeps the node in.
