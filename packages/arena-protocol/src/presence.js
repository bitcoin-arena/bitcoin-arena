// ONLY NODES SEEN IN THE LAST 24 H ARE DRAWN (multiplayer_p2p.md §5A.3 "Absent from its seatings", protocol 22, kanban #727).
//
// Measured on testnet4 2026-10-27: every Up/Down v23 round drew 9 nodes, 7-9 of them stopped test nodes whose bonds were still locked,
// so no round was seated all day. Daniel 14:00Z: "Können die adverts nur gezogen werden von nodes die in den letzten 24h auch online
// waren?" - yes, from 2.0. "Online" from pings is no shared fact, so the rule reads only signed seat messages:
//
//   window      (T - 24 h, T], T the median time past of the census block
//   a seating   one (round, role) whose seating_close (seating.js) falls in the window
//   seen        the node signed a PRESENT (drawn for it or not) or a SEATING of a seating in the window
//   absent      in the chain census, seen at no seating of the window, and drawn for one of them - or left out as absent by the
//               census a window seating was drawn from (absent stays absent until seen)
//   census      from protocol 22 the census is the chain census less every output of an absent node; its root commits to that set
//
// A node drawn for no seating in the window, and left out by no census of one, is not absent: it had nothing to be seen at (a new bond,
// a small stake, a quiet day).
//
// HOW EVERY SEAT AGREES WITHOUT HOLDING THE SAME HISTORY. No two seats hold the same PRESENTs: they are exchanged only among the 9
// drawn nodes of each seating. So the absent set is not recomputed by every seat - it is CHOSEN by the posting node, committed in the
// census root it writes into the series (fixed on chain before the beacon, so it cannot aim at a committee), and CHECKED by every
// other seat one way only: a seat refuses a census that leaves out a node it holds a window signature of, or a node it can show was
// drawn for none of the seatings the claim names. Leaving out fewer than the whole absent set is never refused - keeping a node in is
// the rule before 22. Every refutation is a signed message any seat can check, and the node itself holds its own PRESENTs, so a live
// node can always clear itself.
