// SCALAR MARKETS (kanban #362 feature 8, docs/PLATFORM-RESEARCH.md item 8; protocol 2026.0.7): "a numeric outcome (a price, a
// count) paid linearly between bounds. Richer questions than buckets; one market instead of many."
//
// THE SHAPE. The market's manifest names a scalar (manifest.js `scalar`, marker 0x06): bounds low < high, whole numbers in a named
// unit, and its two outcomes are the SIDES - LONG (pick 0) and SHORT (pick 1). A round of it is an attested round like any
// other: no round byte changes, its entries pick a side. Its attestors - k of n, as for any attested market - sign the VALUE V
// they observed:
//
//     ValueAttestation {
//       round_id, value (i64, in the manifest's unit), observed_at_ms,
//       signatures[] - each { attestor key, signature by it over the body's id }
//     }
//
// A MESSAGE OF ITS OWN: its type byte (0x2a, TYPE_VALUE_ATTESTATION) is not an outcome attestation's (0x1d), its body is written
// at version 7 or later and its id is taken under its own tag (ARENA/v1/ValueAttestation). So an outcome attestation can never be
// replayed as a value or a value as an outcome: the bytes do not decode as the other kind, and a signature over one id is no
// signature over the other's. And each door asks the kind its market reads: attested.js attestationStands refuses an index for a
// scalar market, valueAttestationStands a value for any other.
//
// THE PAYOUT (scalarPayoutTable): V clamped to [low, high]; of the whole net pool T (every entry's stake less its fee and its
// donation, as for any attested round - §0A.8), the LONG side's share is T * (V - low) / (high - low) and the SHORT side's the
// rest; each side's share is split pari-mutuel over that side's own net stakes. Integer msat only, every remainder named:
//   - the two sides' shares are each FLOORED; the at most 1 msat the floors leave goes to the side of the entry FIRST in
//     ascending entry id (among the entries that staked anything) - so the LONG total is ceil or floor of its exact share,
//     never moving against V, and the rule reads the same with the sides swapped and V mirrored;
//   - within a side each entry gets floor(share * net / side_net); the msats those floors leave go one each to that side's
//     entries in ascending entry id - as pariMutuelTable hands out its own.
// Nothing is invented and nothing is kept: fees + donations + payouts = gross, payouts = T, every payout >= 0.
//
// ONE SIDE ONLY (decided here): a market where nobody backed one side has no counterparty - the side's share of a value it
// did not reach would belong to nobody. It is REFUNDED: every net stake back to its own entry, its fee too, exactly as a
// pari-mutuel round "nobody picked" (kanban #235, Daniel 2026-10-09: "refund the fees too"; lock-settlement.js claims nothing).
// Likewise a market with no entry. A round where both sides staked nothing (a free round) is not a refund: each gets its 0.
//
// NO VALUE BY THE DEADLINE, OR TWO DIFFERENT VALUES: VOID, every stake back - attested.js marketVoided reads a value's standing
// as it reads an outcome's (outcomeStanding).
//
// NO CURVE, as everywhere in this package: `verify(signature, digest, key)` is injected - Ed25519, the attestors' scheme.
