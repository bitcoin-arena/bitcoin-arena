// WINNINGS ARE ALWAYS SENT, ON A FEDERATION ROUND (Daniel 2026-09-21 13:25, "winnings are always sent. There is
// no Collect"; ruled for FEDERATION 2026-09-23).
//
// A qualifier's payout is not a contract the winner must collect. It is an LNv2 outgoing contract that ONE
// gateway may claim only by paying the winner's invoice - fetched from the Lightning address the winner gave
// once - and which, unpaid past its expiration, refunds to the round's committee claim key, never the
// winner's: the signer nodes re-send it through another gateway and the winner never acts.
//
// Every signer node rebuilds the settlement byte for byte, so the invoice, the gateway and the expiration are
// one SEND PLAN the coordinating signer node proposes and every other signer node checks for itself before it
// rebuilds (`sendPlanStands`): the invoice's amount is what that gateway's own fee rule leaves of the payout,
// its description hash is sha256 of the address's LNURL metadata (LUD-06), the gateway is the LOWEST KEY among
// the round's federation's distinct live gateways - the set the door counts - and the expiration is inside that
// gateway's own window over the federation's height. A plan that fails any of these is refused, and no payout
// output is built on it. Nothing here moves money or talks to anyone; it is arithmetic and checks.
