// THE BOND OUTPUT KEY, AND WHY IT IS THE ONLY THING A VERIFIER CAN CHECK.
//
// 5A.3B builds the bond as a P2TR output with three spend paths:
//
//     key path      MuSig2(node_key, arbitration_aggregate_key)
//     script path A <node_key> CHECKSIGVERIFY
//                   <bond_maturity> CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP
//     script path B <k-of-m arbitration keys> CHECKMULTISIG
//
// A TAPROOT OUTPUT SHOWS NOTHING UNTIL IT IS SPENT - which is the whole reason
// 5A.3B chose it: "a cooperative release and a cooperative slash are the same
// transaction", and an observer cannot tell a bond was here. So "check the
// script" can never mean READ the script. It means RECOMPUTE: given the keys
// and the maturity a node declares, rebuild the tree, take the tweak, and see
// whether the 32 bytes on chain are the answer. Construction and verification
// are therefore one function used twice, and the second use is what closes
// `BOND_UNCHECKED`'s last entry for anyone holding the declared inputs.
//
// THE CURVE IS INJECTED. Everything here is hashing and byte layout, which
// this package may do; the single point addition Q = P + t*G is not, because
// this is the package every other one reads and it carries no curve. The
// caller passes `tweakPoint`, exactly as 23's advertisement check passes
// `verifyAdvert`.
//
// THE LEAVES ARE THE SPEND PROGRAMS, SO THEY HAVE TO RUN.
//
// 5A.3B writes path A as `<node_key> CHECKSIGVERIFY <bond_maturity>
// CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY DROP` and path B with CHECKMULTISIG. Neither would ever
// spend: the first ends with DROP and therefore an EMPTY stack, and Bitcoin
// requires a true left on it; the second uses an opcode tapscript removed
// (BIP-342), so the leaf is invalid the moment it is revealed.
//
// A leaf is not documentation. It is the program that moves the money, and its
// hash is in the output key - so hashing the faults would mean either a bond
// that can never pay out, or changing the key later and invalidating every
// bond already posted. The whitepaper is intent; it is not a licence to hash
// an unspendable script, exactly as a leftover constant in C# was not a
// licence to copy a wrong unit.
//
// So the INTENT is implemented:
//
//   path A   <maturity> CLTV DROP <node_key> CHECKSIG
//            the timelock first, then the signature that leaves the true
//   path B   <k1> CHECKSIG <k2> CHECKSIGADD ... <km> CHECKSIGADD <k> NUMEQUAL
//            BIP-342's own counting form, which is what tapscript runs
//
// Both say what 5A.3B says - the node alone after maturity, the quorum before
// it - in bytes that a node can actually spend with.
