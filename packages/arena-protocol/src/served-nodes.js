// THE NODES THAT SERVED A ROUND IN THE LAST 24 HOURS (kanban #365, Daniel 2026-10-15: an in-game item's price goes "50% an die
// nodes die in den letzten 24h an einer Runde beteiligt waren"). The part of the item plan that moves no money (plan: comment 2310):
// WHICH nodes, and in how many rounds each, read so that every node arrives at the same list.
//
// WHAT COUNTS AS SERVING: a seat's signed FINAL on a round (final-sig.js) - public, signed by the node's own key, and only a member
// of that round's committee can give one. A round counts once per node, however many entries it signed FINAL for. The window is
// [fromMs, toMs) on the signature's own clock; the caller fixes `toMs` from something every node reads alike (a purchase names its
// anchor block, whose time it is), never its own clock.
//
// THE LIST AND ITS ROOT: the nodes sorted by key, each with its count of rounds; root = taggedHash('ARENA/v1/ServedNodes',
// from || to || [key || rounds]...). A purchase names the root; a node that rebuilds another root from the FINAL signatures it holds
// can show exactly which node or count differs (servedNodesDiffer). Equal or weighted shares are both read from this one list.
//
// NO CURVE: `verify(signature, digest, key)` is injected, as final-sig.js takes it.
