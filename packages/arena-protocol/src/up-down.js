// "BITCOIN UP OR DOWN - 15 MINUTES" (kanban #235/#278; Daniel 2026-10-09: "match this polymarket market" -
// polymarket.com/event/btc-updown-15m-1791598500, series "BTC Up or Down 15m", recurrence 15m). Its rule, verbatim:
//
//   "This market will resolve to "Up" if the time-weighted average price (TWAP) of Bitcoin ... of the time range specified
//    in the title is greater than or equal to the price at the beginning of that range. Otherwise, it will resolve to
//    "Down"."   (source: the Chainlink BTC/USD TWAP 60 s stream)
//
// So: two outcomes, Up (0) and Down (1); the PRICE TO BEAT is the price at the window's start; Up when the window's TWAP is
// at or above it - A TIE IS UP. This file is that rule as a pure function, the one every attestor applies to the samples it
// read, so two honest attestors reading the same samples sign the same outcome. Prices are integers (e.g. USD cents) and
// times ms, both BigInt; no float anywhere.
