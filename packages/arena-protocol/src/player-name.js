// A PLAYER'S NAME, AS THE WHOLE NETWORK SHOWS IT (kanban #397 PIP, Daniel 2026-10-17: "Users can sign in with their ingame key and
// their custom name or their generated name" - "Have custom names in the protocol").
//
// The lobby's name record (lobby-name.js) is one round's: signed by the round key, kept by that round's signer nodes. This one is
// the player's own, for anywhere a player is named outside a round - the proposals forum first: the network it is for, the player's
// IDENTITY key (the key its generated name is made from, display-name.js), when (ms), and the name the player chose - empty for
// none, and then the generated one is shown. The identity key signs it (BIP-340), so a node can leave a name out but cannot write
// one; nodes keep the newest per player and refuse one dated more than PLAYER_NAME_SKEW_MS ahead of their clock. The name is held
// to the lobby's rule (lobbyNameIsValid): one rule names a player everywhere. Like every name, it decides nothing (§0.12).
