// THE CLIENT BUILDS THE COMMITTEE ITSELF (spec 5A.6: "a client MUST NOT take a census, a committee or an

// agreed - so a set of colluding seats could name any committee and be dealt a player's stake.
//
// Here the client derives it from what it checks itself:
//   HEADERS   the chain it agreed from independent providers (directory.js agreedChain), from a compiled-in anchor;
//   CENSUS    every entry of the round's census as EVIDENCE a seat hands over (GET /census): its bond transaction proven
//             into one of those headers, the advertisement it commits to, the output rebuilt as the bond from the
//             network's arbitration set and a curve, its maturity, its floor - and, for a carried bond, its
//             re-affirmation and update, proved and signed by the bond's key. The verified set must hash to the round's
//             own census_root (censusRootOf, the seat's own function): an entry left out, added or altered is another
//             root, and the round is refused. Spentness at census_height is in that root.
//   BEACON    the first block whose median time is past committee_time, deep enough - off the same headers
//             (beaconFromChain), its hash the randomness (committeeSeedFromBeacon);
//   SORTITION selectCommittee over the verified entries, the function a seat's Roster.committeeFor runs.
// This package carries no curve and no signature scheme: `bond` brings the curve operations, `verify` BIP-340.
