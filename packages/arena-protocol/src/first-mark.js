// THE PLAYER'S FIRST MARK AGAINST THE ROUND'S START DEADLINE (§15, §16, §13C).
//
// A round names a start deadline in ticks after a player's join tick (or gets
// START_DEADLINE_TICKS). The first mark - the one that chains to nothing - is
// where the player commits to a first tick, under the entry's session key; the
// tick it names is the player's own, and every signer node reads the same number.
//
// RULED (M3, pick (a)): A FIRST MARK SIGNED AFTER join_tick + THE DEADLINE IS
// THE PLAYER'S OWN ACT, so it is FORFEIT - player conduct (§15: "the player
// normally becomes FAILED or FORFEIT") - and NOT ENTRY_VOID. The world is known
// before the first tick, so a late first mark that refunded would be a refund
// the player chose after seeing the run; §13C: "a player cannot manufacture a
// refund". ENTRY_VOID stays §16's outage refund ("if fewer than 5 game/verify
// nodes are available ... refunded"), and it is not decided here.
//
// In time: nothing is decided here; the mark goes on as any mark. No first mark
// yet: nothing from this function - the walk-away is decided AT THE DOOR once the entry's start window has passed
// (ALL-BUT-MIN-1727, Daniel 2026-09-29 17:27: FORFEIT, score 0, "not left undecided until the close"; the node's
// door sweep, by the close's own peer-checked `stoppedOutcome`), never ENTRY_VOID and never a refund.
//
// THE LOCK: a FORFEIT stake is claimed in the round's settlement transaction
// (§23.2) - W4, parked behind the fee-lock ruling. Until then a FORFEIT lock
// refunds at expiry: the money hole every loser has, listed, not closed.
