// (game_id, §0A.3), and a core is known only as a core of the game the round names, under a config that game lists for
// it. This client refuses. There is no override: no flag, no query parameter, nothing that lets an unknown game through.
// (§0A.6's confirmed stake on an unlisted game, shown with its developer key and manifest id, is the lobby's, #208.)
//
// F2's second clause rests on it (FEDERATION.md): the player's key is theirs only if the code that decides the round is
// code they can know.
