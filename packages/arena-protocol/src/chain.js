// Reading Bitcoin without trusting whoever handed it to you.
//
// Section 25.1 is normative about this, and says why it is normative rather
// than advisory: "A client MUST verify every census entry against block
// headers it obtained independently. It MUST NOT take a census, a committee or
// an endpoint on the word of any API, including one operated by the same party
// that ships the client... A client that silently trusts a chain API behaves
// exactly like one that verifies - same screens, same rounds, same results -
// right up until the API returns a census that suits whoever runs it, and then
// the player has been playing against a committee that was never selected.
// There is no symptom to notice and nothing for the player to check."
//
// So these are the primitives that make a provider usable without being
// trusted. They fetch nothing: a proof and a header are handed in, and what
// comes back is whether they hold together. "A list provider can then OMIT but
// not FORGE, and omission is answered by asking a second one."
//
// NOTHING HERE IS BITCOIN CONSENSUS. It does not validate scripts, amounts or
// difficulty retargeting; it answers two questions only - is this transaction
// in this header's block, and which of these header chains carries the most
// work. That is what discovery needs and it is deliberately not more.

 * zero, was accepted as a bond by `deriveCensus`. A publisher could point an
 * entry at a change output instead and inflate its own weight.
 *
 * TWO OF THE FIVE RULES CAN BE READ, AND THREE CANNOT:
 *
 *   readable   the output is P2TR. 5A.3B: "A P2TR output with three spend
 *              paths". The paths are hidden; the class is not - witness v1,
 *              a 32-byte program, `OP_1 <32 bytes>`. An OP_RETURN or a P2PKH
 *              is not the thing 5A.3B describes, whatever else is true.
 *   readable   the advertisement names THIS outpoint. 5A.1 makes the bond
 *              outpoint mandatory, so a body that points somewhere else is
 *              not this output's body. The all-zero txid is read as "the
 *              transaction carrying me", the same reading `acceptAdvert`
 *              settled: 25.1 puts the body in the transaction it names, so
 *              the txid is not knowable when the body is signed.
 *
 *   readable   the dust output to BOND_MARKER (25.1) on regtest and testnet.
 *              Mainnet still has no marker. A funding transaction without that
 *              output cannot be found in compact filters and is not a bond.
 *   BLOCKED    the script tree is 5A.3B's template. Taproot reveals a branch
 *              only when it is spent, which is the point of using it.
 *   BLOCKED    the advertisement signature. No curve in this package.

 * The whole of step 4: where do I reach this node, and why should I believe it?

 * output is. The advertisement is the body that the bond output commits to, so
 * that chain data alone identifies both the node and its terms."
 *
 * WHAT IS HANDED IN IS RAW BYTES, NOT FINDINGS. The transaction, a branch, a
 * header. The txid is computed from the transaction and the commitment is read
 * out of its outputs, because the earlier shape of this function took both as
 * arguments and that made the proof theatre: whoever handed over the
 * advertisement also handed over the hash of the advertisement they wanted,
 * their own txid to go with it, and every check passed. The page could put any
 * endpoint it liked behind a real block. Now the only inputs are bytes whose
 * hashes it does not control.
 *
 *   the transaction is really in the block   or a provider invented it
 *   an output really commits to THIS body    or a provider swapped the endpoint
 *
 * The second is the one that matters in practice, because a swapped endpoint
 * is invisible: the node is real, the bond is real, and the player connects to
 * whoever the provider preferred. So the answer names which failed.
 *
 * The body may come from the transaction's own witness (25.1: "the body of
 * 5A.1 is carried in the witness of the funding transaction") or be handed in
 * beside it. It does not matter which, and that is the point - the witness is
 * not covered by the txid, so a body from either place has to earn its standing
 * from the committed output, and one that cannot is refused the same way.
 *
 * THE SIGNATURE IS RETURNED, NOT CHECKED. 5A.1 ends the body with "signature -
 * by node_pubkey over all of the above", and this package carries no crypto on
 * purpose: a curve in here would be an implementation of the thing that pins
 * money, sitting in every consumer, that nobody audits. So a body must ARRIVE
 * signed - 64 bytes beside it, or it is not an advertisement - and the caller
 * that owns a verifier is the one that says whether the signature is good.
