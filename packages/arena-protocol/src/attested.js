// AN ATTESTED OUTCOME AND THE PARI-MUTUEL TABLE (§0A.7a, kanban #206, Daniel 2026-10-07): the result of a round of an
// attested game - a prediction market - is not a replayed run but the outcome its attestors sign. The game's manifest
// names the outcomes, the attestor keys and how many of them must sign (k of n, chosen by the game dev); a round's
// entries each back one outcome (contracts.js `pick`); and the payout is pari-mutuel: the losing picks' net stakes are
// split over the winning picks in proportion to their net stakes. No game code runs anywhere in this.
//
//     OutcomeAttestation {
//       round_id, outcome (index into the manifest's outcomes), observed_at_ms,
//       signatures[] - each { attestor key, signature by it over the body's id }
//     }
//
// The attestors sign the BODY's id (TAG.outcomeAttestation over round_id, outcome, observed_at_ms); signatures are not in
// what they sign. NO CURVE, as everywhere in this package: `verify(signature, digest, key)` is injected - Ed25519, the
// scheme the game's own manifest is signed with.
//
// WHAT VERIFY MEANS WITHOUT A REPLAY: a seat checks the signatures against the manifest's attestor set and the threshold,
// the round, and the outcome's range - nothing else of the world. WHAT AN OBJECTION IS: two attestations for one round,
// each standing on its own, naming different outcomes. That pair is the proof; a round holding it settles on neither.
