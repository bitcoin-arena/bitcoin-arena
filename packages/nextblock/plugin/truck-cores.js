// nextblock's rounds with (the truck and the four it keeps installed beside it), the configs each plays, the replay
// bundle each round's page runs, and the game's manifest - registered with a node by its launcher (arena-node/src/main.js),
// never imported by the engine. It lives outside core/src, so no core hash moves with it.
//
// The engine reads a core only through its adapter (start, eventsOf, step, stateHash, result, picture, runTicksFits) and
// a game only through its manifest (arena-protocol/src/manifest.js); this file is where nextblock hands it both.
