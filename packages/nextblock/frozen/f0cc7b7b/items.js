// it by - the unlock a purchase pays for. A run is handed the unlocks of the items its entry plays with (adapter.js start); an unlock
// this core does not know changes nothing. Kept beside the hashed state, as the run length is: a run without an item hashes as before.

/** THE LARGER TRUCK (Daniel 2026-10-15: "a larger truck for 500 satoshis. It can load 30% more packages and is slightly faster";
 * the pick the same evening: "Slightly faster is acceleration ... 15% higher acceleration than the stock truck, in the same core
 * units", the top speed not raised): the bed 1.3 times as long (3.9 m: 30 % more room, so the same load fills less of it), the drive
 * acceleration 1.15 times (5.00 m/s^2 at rest against 4.35), and the taper's reference speed set so that flat out, on flat ground, it
 * tops out exactly where the larger truck accepted before it did: 25.30 m/s (tools/measure-large-truck.mjs; the standard truck 24.39).
 * More acceleration alone would have raised that, since the top speed is where the tapered drive meets the drag. */
