/**
 * What being hurt costs the driving.
 *
 * `TruckController` held this: `hurt = 1 - condition`, and above 0.02 the
 * throttle is scaled by `Lerp(1, 0.55, hurt)` and the steering takes a pull of
 * `pull * hurt * 0.35` to one side. It ran on `condition`, which `TruckHealth`
 * set from its own pool - a client rule reading a client number, and both are
 * gone.
 *
 * IT WAS ALSO ALREADY DEAD where the core drives. `CoreDrivenTruck` makes the
 * Rigidbody kinematic, and the block that follows this one in
 * `TruckController` takes its speed from `_rb.linearVelocity`, which a
 * kinematic body reports as zero - so the throttle and steer it adjusted were
 * being fed to wheel colliders that resolve nothing. Porting those lines into
 * the client would have been copying a PhysX-era corpse. The rule belongs
 * where the throttle is actually spent, which is here. Nothing here reads a
 * host velocity, and there is no 2-D coupling: the taper touches the throttle
 * and the pull touches the steer, each on its own axis.
 *
 * Measured before it was written: over three seeds the truck is under 98 hit
 * points for 91.4% of the ticks of a full-throttle run and 90.5% of a parked
 * one, mean `hurt` 0.205 and 0.847. This is most of a round, not a corner.
 *
 * The pull direction is `Random.value < 0.5 ? -1 : 1` once at Awake in C#.
 * Here it is derived from the seed rather than drawn, because draw order is
 * protocol and a new draw at init would move every stream after it.
