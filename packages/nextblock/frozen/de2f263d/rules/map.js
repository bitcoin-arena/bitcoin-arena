// THE MAP'S OWN COLLISION BOXES, AND THEY BELONG HERE.
//
// The world solids used to be Unity's: `WorldSolids.Gather` collected every
// BoxCollider the player had BUILT AT RUNTIME and `CoreDrivenTruck.UploadSolids`
// sent them to the core - re-sending whenever the count changed, so the world
// the core resolved against moved mid-run as models streamed in. No replay set
// any at all, so a committee resolved every drive against nothing. Measured:
// one box on the path moves a 600-tick drive 40.233 m, more than the 33.500 m
// the ground was worth.
//
// So the boxes are made here, from the map's own geometry, the same way the
// relief is. THE NUMBERS ARE THE MAP'S and they were taken from a running
// player rather than from a reading of the code: 37 boxes, four map edges, the
// post office shell of twenty-five pillars on the bays' own 6.8 m pitch with
// its two ends and its lintel, and the miner's facade, lintel and tunnel
// sides. `SolidsInventoryTests` prints the set a real Bootstrap builds and
// pins it against these.
//
// EVERY HEIGHT IS SAMPLED FROM THE GROUND THIS CORE GENERATED. A shell sits at
// one terrain sample and the relief falls away to either side, which is why
// each one is buried: twenty metres of footing, so a truck cannot drive under
// a wall where the ground drops. That was Unity's reasoning and it is right;
// what changes is that the sample is now the core's own.

  // ---- THE MINER'S CORRIDOR ------------------------------------------------
  //
  // MEASURED 2026-09-20: 452 of the miner's 904 drawn parts carried no box at all, 46 of them standing in the
  // entry corridor below a truck's height, and a truck driven down the lane passed 1.27 m - its FULL body
  // radius, through the middle and not a graze - through five of them on every one of five approaches. The five
  // boxes above are the facade and the tunnel's outer walls; they leave the corridor itself unlined, which is
  // why a tank can stand in a drawn cable.
  //
  // These are those parts, read from the model through Unity's own 180-degree turn and (1, 0.45, 1) scale and
  // written here in the units the core keeps. They are NOT a mesh collider and nothing was copied from the C#:
  // DeliveryGate's five Slab() calls still build the five above, and that agreement is left exactly as it was.
  //
  // WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and it is a ruling rather than an oversight (Daniel 2026-09-20):
  //   mass_behind_tunnel         hangs from y 2.7 m across the whole approach while the truck's body is 3.26 m,
  //                              so its roof passes 0.56 m through it. The delivery gate is at x 169, PAST that
  //                              mass at x 119..145, so a solid there closes the only route to the miner. The
  //                              ceiling is passable BY RULING, and the 0.56 m is Unity's (1, 0.45, 1) height
  //                              scale rather than a missing slab. Raising the miner is a later item.
  //   tunnel_end_backglow, tunnel_grid_h_0 and _h_1, tunnel_grid_v_5/6/7, btc_medallion_tunnel_end
  //                              the same thing at the tunnel mouth: measured, these seven span the driving lane
  //                              at truck height, and the gate is beyond them. A box on any of them closes the
  //                              route as surely as the mass does. Nothing solid stands within 6 m of the centre
  //                              line at truck height, so the run-in is always open.
  // THE FINISH STRAIGHT IS FREE (Daniel 2026-09-25 21:19: "The finish-straight passage must be completely free. A
  // truck at speed crosses it with no hit and no slowdown from a collider ... Whatever is now in that passage, in the
  // core or in Unity, comes out. Do not add a box to keep the mesh honest if it stands in the passage").
  //   MEASURED before (straight.mjs, 20 seeds, full throttle from x 60): on the spawn bay's own lane, z 10.2, 17 of
  //   20 runs never delivered, stopped on tunnel_grid_v_4; on the centre line 3 of 20, on tunnel_grid_v_9 and _v_4;
  //   at z -6, 9 of 20 on tunnel_grid_v_8. The mouth's ten grid columns (x 145.4, |z| 10.2 .. 31.4, 4 m apart) were a
  //   fence across the finish, and its three bars (z +-33, from 3.55 m) were a ceiling 0.29 m over the truck that any
  //   rise in the run-in brought down onto it.
  //   OUT, and not to come back: tunnel_grid_v_0 .. _4 and _8 .. _12, tunnel_grid_h_1 .. _3, and power_cable_0 / _1
  //   (x 108.4 .. 120.8, |z| 22.4 .. 34.2), which stood inside the mouth where a truck from an outer bay funnels in.
  //   The passage is the tunnel between its ribs, |z| < 32.8, from the miner's door to the gate: nothing in it is
  //   solid at any height. The walls, ribs, jambs and seams line it and stay; the coin stacks are past the gate and
  //   outside the mouth, and stay.
  // THE CORRIDOR LINING IS OUT, AND THE COIN STACKS STAND WHERE THEY ARE DRAWN (Daniel 2026-09-26 07:18, phone, block
  // 968644: "The collisions left and right of the finish straight are wrong. They come out. The passage stays free ...
  // The circled stack needs a collision. You can drive through it now. The box is where that drawn stack stands, not
  // where an old measurement put coin_stack").
  //
  // MEASURED 2026-09-26 in a real Bootstrap world (PlayMode, the .glb handed to DeliveryGate.ShowMiner as the streamer
  // does, Renderer.bounds in world metres): the model is no longer turned about or squashed to 0.45 in height, so the
  // 2026-09-20 reading of it is MIRRORED about the miner's origin x 169 and 0.45 too low. The tunnel's walls, ribs and
  // jambs are drawn at x 169..193 - inside the building, past the gate - where this list had them at x 145..169,
  // lining the finish straight with 26 boxes nothing draws. They come out and are not put back: a run is over at the
  // gate, so nothing past it is ever driven. The stacks are drawn at x 145.6..164.4, not 173.6..192.4:

  //
  // The miner is drawn 0.40 m above the core's ground there (tunnel_wall at world 0.42, core 0.02), so the heights
