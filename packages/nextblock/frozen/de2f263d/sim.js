 * off, otherwise `Damage(rammed * 6f)` - and that was client-side simulation
 * of an outcome, which is what M1 removes.
 *
 * The quantity is a SPEED and it always was: `TakeImpact` is `T_IMPACT / ONE`

 * velocity along the contact normal. No distance was read as a speed here, so
 * there is no units fault to avoid copying - the six is points per metre per

 * billion, and a cube root turns that into a factor of ten instead of the
 * 31.6 a square root would give. Both ends are quantities this core already
 * names rather than numbers picked to taste - `BOMB_RADIUS`, 16 m, at one
 * million, and the 40 m front band at a thousand.
 *
 * DEPTH IS 0.225 OF THE RADIUS, AND THAT NUMBER IS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. The
 * geologist's ratio for a simple crater is a fifth of the diameter - 0.4 of
 * the radius - and at 0.4 the truck is trapped: driven from the centre at
 * full throttle it never leaves a 100 M crater or a 1000 M one in forty
 * seconds, and takes 36.2 s to crawl out of the smallest.
 *
 * The wall's steepest gradient is exactly 2 * D/R. Driven up a constant slope
 * the truck holds 0.45 - 2.03 m/s uphill - and at 0.50 it slides backwards.
 * So D/R must be under 0.225, and this sits ON that limit rather than half of
 * it. A hole a player cannot see is not a crater, and 0.15 was the cautious
 * end of the same rule rather than a second measurement.
 *
 * The whole ladder was driven again, from the crater floor at full throttle,
 * to find where the wall actually beats the truck rather than where the
 * arithmetic says it should:
 *
 *   D/R 0.150   1000 M floor  -6.00 m   out after  5.3 s
 *   D/R 0.180   1000 M floor  -7.20 m   out after  5.4 s
 *   D/R 0.200   1000 M floor  -8.00 m   out after  5.5 s
 *   D/R 0.225   1000 M floor  -9.00 m   out after  5.7 s
 *   D/R 0.250   1000 M floor -10.00 m   out after 10.8 s
 *   D/R 0.300   1000 M floor -12.00 m   NEVER out in 40 s
 *
 * So the cliff is between 0.25 and 0.30, and 0.225 costs 0.4 s over 0.15.
 * Doubling was asked for and is not available: at 0.30 the truck cannot leave

 * How hard the fallout bites at the centre of a crater, in health a second.

 * BOTH ENDS ARE MEASURED, not chosen. Driven across the diameter at full
 * throttle the truck spends 4.1, 4.8 and 6.3 seconds inside the radius of a
 * 10, 100 and 1000 million crater, and the bowl profile it drives through
 * integrates to 2.25, 2.66 and 3.51 second-equivalents. Against those two
 * measurements the rule is anchored on quantities the core already carries:
 *
 *   the small end   one crossing costs about one shell. A courier hit is
 *                   `Rand(5, 11)`, and the crossing of a 1 M crater is
 *                   MEASURED at 9.9 health - inside that band. The first
 *                   attempt used 4 a second on an integral guessed from the
 *                   10 M crossing and cost 14.0, outside it; the constant
 *                   follows the measurement rather than the estimate.
 *   the large end   one crossing at full health is lethal. The truck has
 *                   100, and the crossing of a 1000 M crater is measured at
 *                   exactly that.
 *
 * Between them it rides the SAME normalised load the radius, the depth and
 * the lifetime ride, recovered from the stored radius so it costs no state
 * word. One rule, four consequences.
 *
 * The falloff is the bowl's own, `1 - (r/R)^2`: the fallout lies where the
 * ground was thrown out of, so the deepest place is the worst place, and
 * there is one shape in this letter rather than two.
 *
 * NOT divided by `TRUCK_ARMOUR`, and that is deliberate rather than
 * forgotten. Every other hit on the truck is, because 1.5 is plating against
 * a shell and a blast. The contract's word here is IRRADIATED, and plating is

 * so every committee, and every GHOST a committee draws, walked a run the war
 * was hunting less hard than it hunted the player. Measured on one drive: the
