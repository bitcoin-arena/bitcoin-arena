 * out of bitcoin_miner_megastructure.glb, through DeliveryGate's 180-degree turn and (1, 0.45, 1) scale, the miner
 * stands on the ground from x 53.8 m (power cables), with feet at 62.8, legs at 66.9 and its lower mass from 64.4;
 * its entry corridor, |z| <= 34 m, is clear of all of that from x 90.4 m east. So the old fit put the last nine
 * slots and 24 m of road INSIDE the building (miner-entrance-covered-1309.jpg). The same fit, done against the
 * measured door instead of the origin: the same 32 slots, the same west end, pitch 5.75624 -> 5.18124 m, the last
 * slot ending at 89.99983 m. The miner does not move and the map's edges do not move. MINER_DOOR_X in map.js is the
 * door itself, and the road ribbon ends there too - Unity draws what the core says.
 * slot k holds the round's candle whose samples are tape k*2 + (taken & 1) and the next, so its centre is that pair's middle.
 * Measured before: at a candle's centre the seam read the tape up to 9.7 samples away, and HUD YOU sat on the wrong candle
 * for 28-29 of 32.

 * The tape, box-averaged over WINDOW samples, edges held.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS A FILTER HERE AT ALL. The tape is a price series and the raw
 * function laid it across the map at one sample every 4.13 m, so the "front"
 * was a price chart, not a line: measured across the map it ran +29.1, +2.6,
 * +37.6, +5.8, +28.1, -8.6, +8.8, -40.5, -28.4 at 22 m steps. A man walking
 * nine metres sideways saw his goal move sixty. Chasing it, nobody ever
 * arrived - infantry sat 36.5 m behind a line whose own standoff is 8.
 *
 * THE WIDTH IS DERIVED, NOT PICKED. A rifleman closes in z at 3.4 m/s and
 * moves in x at 2.4 m/s (`Army.cs:681`), so a goal that slides more than
 * 3.4/2.4 = 1.42 metres per metre of x runs away faster than he can walk.
 * Measured over five tapes, the raw slope is 6.00 mean and 14.21 at the 99th
 * percentile, with 88% of the map above the limit. Box-averaged:
 *
 *     N     mean   p99    max   over the limit   amplitude
 *      1    6.00  14.21  14.35      88.0%        +-56.7 m
 *      9    0.93   2.66   2.80      22.9%        +-38.5 m
 *     13    0.56   1.80   1.93       3.7%        +-42.7 m
 *     21    0.42   1.20   1.27       0.0%        +-39.5 m
 *
 * 21 is the first width where the 99th percentile AND the maximum are both
 * under 1.42 and no part of the map is above it. Wider only costs amplitude:
 * the front must still move with the market, and at 21 it still swings
 * +-39.5 m across the map.
 *
 * The normalisation below deliberately keeps the RAW window's low and high,
 * not the smoothed one's. Renormalising against the smoothed range would
 * re-expand the filtered curve to full scale and put the slope back: measured,
 * that variant still leaves 9.9% of the map over the limit at N=21.
 *
 * C# has no filter. This is not a port of `PriceHistory.FrontlineZ` losing a
 * term - it is the core refusing to copy a fault: a quantity used as a FRONT
 * LINE cannot have 4 m resolution and 60 m steps, whatever it was called
 * upstream.
