// THE TRUCK GAME, AS A CORE A SEAT REPLAYS (M3; Daniel 2026-09-15 08:03 and 08:07).
//
// The seats are a network the truck game runs on, not the game. They replay the core a round names
// - its sim_wasm_hash - and read no truck, cargo or map themselves: this is the one face the truck
// shows them, the same calls every core a seat can replay answers. It lives in core/src, so the
// core's hash covers it: what a run came to is decided here, by the core, not by a seat. The page's
// bundle does not carry it - the page drives sim.js itself, and nothing bundled imports this file.
