// A LATE JOINER RESUMES WHERE THEIR ENTRY SAYS THEY JOINED, NOT AT TICK ZERO.
//
// 0.8: "Late join is a normal feature, not merely reconnect." Section 7: "Late
// joins simply add more Entry Contracts. The Round Contract is never
// rewritten."
//
// Measured before this file existed: `resume` set `nextTick = last ?
// batchTicks(last).at(-1) + 1 : 0`. That `: 0` is the reconnect of a player
// who joined at tick 50 and had not published anything yet - a page reload
// between joining and the first batch - and it resumed numbering from zero.
// Every batch after that would carry the inputs of one tick under the number
// of another, and the node would refuse them with "expected tick 50, got 0"
// while the page looked healthy.
//
// The entry is FETCHED AND THEN HASHED rather than taken on the node's word:
// an entry id is the hash of its bytes, so a node that returns somebody else's
// entry, or the same one with a friendlier join tick, does not hash to what
// was asked for.
