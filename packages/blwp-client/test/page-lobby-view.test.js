// THE LOBBY ROW UNITY DRAWS, AS THE PAGE HANDS IT OVER (kanban #43, Daniel 2026-10-06: "the lobby row must not read as if a
// round lasted 2 minutes"). index.html's lobbyViewRow is lifted out of the page by its text and run as it is. Each row
// carries startS - whole seconds until the round starts, 0 once it has started - and leftS, the seconds until its entry
// closes, both from the round's own times (not parsed back out of a text line). A row with no times says -1 for both.
