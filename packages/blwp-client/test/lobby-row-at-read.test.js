// THE PAID ROW A FUNDED SEAT READS IS THE ROUND IT CAN STILL ENTER (kanban #121, Daniel 2026-10-05: "A funded seat reads one
// lobby row before it pays. That row is the round it can still enter. It is not the round after next."). The playtest of
// 10-04 13:45 saw the round after next ("closes 1:52"); measured 10-05 01:30-01:33Z on 0.0.2740 with a seat holding 100 sat,
// the row was never the round after next, but at each rollover Unity read the closed round ("closes in 0:00", not joinable)
// for a further ~1 s, because the row was the LAST PAINT's pick. The row is picked when it is read, at the read's clock,
// funded or not: lobbyRowsAt. A join held on a round keeps that round (lobbyKeepJoined, Daniel 2026-10-02).
