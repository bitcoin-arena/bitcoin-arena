// THE PLAYER'S SOCKET DROPPING BEFORE THE ROUND STARTS (rig from own-socket-drop.test.js).
//
// Measured 2026-09-10 on one real daemon, the page's reconnect wired as the
// bridge wires it: the socket closed twice with a batch in flight, and the
// client counted each close as the node refusing ("error the socket closed"),
// resynced on the first and ended an honest run on the second: "VOID: the
// node refuses this run's inputs at tick 60". The node refused nothing.
//
// And when the node HAD taken the batch and only the answer was lost, the
// resume read the node's next tick but kept the words in the hold, so they
// went out again at the node's next tick: tick 90 held the input recorded for
// 60, and the node held 150 ticks for 120 recorded.
//
// Every tick here carries its own index in its second word, so a tick that
// lands anywhere but its own place is seen.
// A FREE ROUND (RULED Daniel 2026-09-25): nothing this file asserts depends on the stake, and a paying round opens only
// on a signer node that reaches a federation now.
