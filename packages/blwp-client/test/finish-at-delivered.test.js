// THE RUN STOPS WHEN THE CORE SAYS IT IS OVER (Daniel 2026-09-15 16:14).
//
// Measured before, replaying every run a signer node held: each truck that drove into the miner's
// mouth was DELIVERED in the core - and its page recorded 620 to 5319 more ticks (10-89 s) while the
// truck sat at the tunnel's back wall. `finish` is handed the core's word by the page; this measures
// what it does with it on one real daemon: every held tick reaches the node, nothing after, the run
// ends FINISHED (not an outcome - that is the replay's), and the socket is closed.
