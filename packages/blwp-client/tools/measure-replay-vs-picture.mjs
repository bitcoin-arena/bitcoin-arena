// THE PICTURE AGAINST THE NODE'S OWN REPLAY OF THE SAME TRANSCRIPT (Daniel 2026-09-18 13:05).
//
// The previous measurement stepped a bare core beside the run and read 0.000 m in one round and 53 m in the next,
// growing 0.1 m at a time - a separation, not an offset. A bare core is not the world the node replays: `replay.js`
// applies the round's own events - liquidations, loads, price samples and the live tape - each before its own tick,
// and the ground of this game moves with them. So this asks the node's own replay, in this process, over the very
// transcript the driver published, for the same ticks the watcher was pictured at.
//
// If the two agree, the earlier gap was the harness and the ghost sits where that player's core says. If they do not,
// the node's live ghost and the node's own replay disagree with each other, which is a fault in the picture path.
