// IS THE DRAWN GHOST THE OTHER CLIENT'S TRUCK? (Daniel 2026-09-18 12:02: "Drawn pose must match the other client's
// truck", and the shots where the other truck is not where it can be seen.)
//
// Step two of the agreed order, after the round-boundary counts. Every picture names a TICK; this steps a core of the
// driver's own world with the driver's own inputs to that same tick and compares the two poses, word for word in
// Q16.16. Same tick, same world:
//   - if they differ, the node's replay and the driver's core are in different worlds, and no drawing rule can fix it
//   - if they agree, every "wrong place" a player sees is staleness: a picture that is old, or a truck of a round
//     that is over, which is what the round-boundary counts already found
//
// The driver DRIVES here rather than standing at its door - a parked truck would make any two worlds agree.
