// WHAT A WATCHER HOLDS WHEN THE ROUND TURNS OVER (Daniel 2026-09-18 12:02: "after 2nd round Truck 1 cannot see
// Truck 2. Age 6736ms on young-hawk-9551").
//
// The four counts asked for, per round, measured on the Daily with real seats and the page's own client:
//   - trucks still drawn from a round this watcher has left
//   - first pictures dropped by the "superseded" rule (a new entry of a player whose old truck is still drawn)
//   - whether the clear fired: in the page `BlwpNextGhost` writes tick -2 when it meets a NEW field object, so what
//     is counted here is whether a round got a new field at all
//   - pictures that name an entry of a round this pair has left
//
// AND THE CASE THAT MATTERS: a watcher that keeps its field across the boundary. Daniel's Truck 1 was looking at a
// truck whose newest picture was 6.7 s old and climbing - since 0.0.1591 a silence no longer retires it, so if
// nothing else takes it away it stands for ever. Both are driven here: a watcher rebuilt for the new round the way a
// player pressing PLAY gets one, and a watcher that is not.
