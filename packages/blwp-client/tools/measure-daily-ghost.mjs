// WHAT A PLAYER'S GHOST ACTUALLY DOES ON THE DAILY, AND WHETHER THE SIGNER NODES' LEFTOVER STALLS MOVE IT
// (Daniel 2026-09-17 19:15, the ghost letter's remainder: live nodes are median 14 ms and p90 21 ms, with a max of
// 552 ms and two stalls over 300 ms a minute, attributed to the close / finality path).
//
//     node tools/measure-daily-ghost.mjs [--minutes=10] [--daily=/mnt/bitcoin/blwp-2of2]
//
// THREE STREAMS AT ONCE, from outside the daemons:
//   the DRIVER   a stake-0 entry in the Daily's free round, recording a tick every 1/60 s and draining every sixth,
//                which is `BlwpNet.BatchEvery` and the drain rule the page ships. The truck is parked - the pictures
//                are what is measured, not where they are.
//   the WATCHER  a second stake-0 entry in the same round, subscribed, recording every picture of the driver: when it
//                arrived and which tick it names. A picture is never sent to the entry that made it (`interestSet`
//                drops the viewer), so watching needs its own seat - two tabs, as a player would have.
//   the PINGER   both nodes' /play sockets at 10 Hz. A text frame is answered on the event loop, so a gap in the
//                answers is the loop held, whatever held it.
// And the daemons' own log is tailed with an arrival stamp per line, so a stall can be ATTRIBUTED: close / finality
// only when a [close], [verify], [settle], [payout] or [custody] line falls inside that stall's window, and
// unattributed otherwise. Nothing here is assumed.
//
// NOTHING IN THIS FILE IS AN INPUT TO ANYBODY'S SIMULATION. It drives one truck of its own and reads pictures.
