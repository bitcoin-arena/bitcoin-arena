// THE DEPOSIT INVOICE AS A QR CODE (Daniel 2026-09-30: the deposit needs a QR code).
// A phone's Lightning wallet scans it instead of the player copying the invoice. Encoded here, in the pinned bundle, with
// qrcode-generator (MIT, no dependencies): a QR picture is what a player pays, so it is built by the same audited script
// that made the invoice, not by a loose one beside the page. BOLT11 is case-insensitive and its upper case fits the
// QR alphanumeric mode, as wallets write it; the `lightning:` scheme is the one wallets open.
