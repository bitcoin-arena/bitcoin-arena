// THE PAGE COUNTS THE FEDERATION'S BONDED GUARDIANS ITSELF (§23.6, P3; Daniel
// 2026-09-15 07:33: "every guardian / node must have its own bond or it may not
// take part. federationIsBonded stays on").
//
// A seat counts them before it seats a paying round (server.js guardiansBonded),
// and the page used to take that on the seats' word: the seats are the ones a
// creator could have chosen. Here the page counts on its own evidence, every
// piece of it checked rather than handed over:
//
//   the guardians   off the config the page's own lock client downloaded from
//                   the federation it joined (lock client `guardians()`: the
//                   broadcast keys and fedimint's threshold) - not a seat's list;
//   the chain       headers the page agreed from independent providers
//                   (`agreedChain`), each linked and mined;
//   each bond       a transaction proven into a block of that chain, committing
//                   to an advertisement signed by the node it names, at least the
//                   round's census_confirmations deep, worth at least its bond_min.
//
// WHERE THE BONDS COME FROM IS A HINT. A seat, a provider, a list on the page -
// whoever names candidate guardian nodes can only omit, never forge: an offer
// that does not prove is set aside with its reason, and the count is only over
// what proved. Omitting enough to fall under the threshold is a refusal, which
// is where a lie about the list can take a player: to no round, not to a bad one.
//
// NOT CHECKED HERE: whether a proven bond is still unspent. Headers carry no
// spends, and the seat's census reads them from the chain it indexed. A spent
// bond counted here is one a seat's own count refuses.
