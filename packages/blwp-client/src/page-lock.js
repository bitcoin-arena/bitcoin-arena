//
// The lock client (lock-client/, the stock fedimint 0.12.0 client crates built
// to wasm) is INJECTED, like the curve: this bundle carries no crypto and no
// federation code. What is here decides only what the lock client is asked -
// which federation, under whose secret, how much, to which keys, until when,
// all read off the round, the dealt stake and the attested claim key - and it
// refuses an answer that is not the lock it asked for (`lockFromClient`).
//
// AND IT HANDS THE LOCK TO THE SIGNER NODES once they hold the entry: a signer node verifies
// it in the federation and only then counts the stake (§23.1 step 5).
//
// A RELOAD LOSES NOTHING. The lock client's wallet is kept in the tab
// (`lockStoreFor`), so a reload between the deposit and the lock reopens the
// wallet that holds it; and a lock already made, that no signer node has committed
// yet, is kept with its stake (`saveLock`), so a reload before the signer node takes
// the entry uses that lock instead of dealing and paying again.
