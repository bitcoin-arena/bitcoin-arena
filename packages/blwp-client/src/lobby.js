// THE LOBBY, AS THE PAGE READS IT (M3.3-34, §25).
//
// "Find a round: link, QR, copied round_id, a lobby - carries nothing." So the
// page is handed the same names a join link carries - the nodes, where the bond
// and the headers are asked for, the signed advertisement - and NO round. It
// asks each named node which rounds it holds (GET /rounds), and every id it is
// told of is fetched and hashed exactly as a join link's is (`fetchRound`): a
// node that lists a round and answers with a different contract gets no row.
//
// WHAT A ROW SAYS COMES FROM THE CONTRACT, NOT FROM THE LISTING. Whether a round
// is free (no stake, no wallet, no Lightning) and whether its entry is open are
// read off the verified contract and this page's clock. The signer node counts are
// shown as what each node says.
//
// AND JOIN IS OFFERED AT THE ROUND'S THRESHOLD OF ITS OWN SIGNER NODES (2 of 2 here,
// 5 of 7 on mainnet). Every mark needs that many receipts, so a round only one
// signer node of a 2-of-2 holds is a round nobody can play. Each signer node signs its
// listing under its node key (lobby-listing.js); a row is joinable only when
// that many DISTINCT keys the verified contract names have signed "open,
// joined here", recently. One server cannot sign for two signer nodes.
//
// Joining is the join link: the same query with `round=` added. Nothing here
// signer nodes anybody, and nothing here mints a round.
//
// AND WHO IS JOINED, BY THE NAMES THEY CHOSE: each signer node serves the name records
// its joined players signed (lobby-name.js); a row carries the ones that check
// (identity.js `checkedNames`) - never a key in place of a name.
