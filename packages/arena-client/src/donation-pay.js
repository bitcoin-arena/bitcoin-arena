/**
 * THE PLAYER'S DONATION, PAID (M3.2 item 6e; §22A, §24A.2, §27A.4; ruled
 * 2026-09-13).
 *
 * "Donations are paid: LNURL per recipient, by share, from the player's wallet
 * directly at entry - never through the federation" (§24A.2). Two halves:
 *
 * `fetchDonationSet` - the set the round names, as EVERY signer node of the round
 * serves it (a signer node that serves another, or none, is a refusal), signed by the
 * network's donation authority at the round's height with rotations included,
 * checked with Ed25519 (the authority's scheme). The page shows every
 * recipient from it before the wallet approves (§22A).
 *
 * `Client.payDonation(entry, set)` (client.js, beside `payStake`) - AN ENTRY AND
 * A SET, NEVER AN INVOICE. The amounts
 * come from `splitDonation` over the entry's own donation; each recipient's
 * endpoint is asked for its pay request and then for an invoice of exactly its
 * share, and only an invoice that is that share under the endpoint's own
 * metadata hash (LUD-06) reaches the wallet, through the same `payInvoice` the
 * stake uses. A failed share is reported and never redirected to the others
 * (§22A); the entry stands either way. A 0% entry pays nothing and asks nobody.
 *
 * MEASURED BEFORE: no LNURL, bech32 or BOLT11 code existed; `splitDonation`
 * had no caller; `pay_invoice` had one call site, the stake; a 2% donor's 2000
 * msat was taken by nobody.
