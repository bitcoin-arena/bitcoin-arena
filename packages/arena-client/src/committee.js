//   1. the headers, agreed from the round's nodes' GET /headers (at least two sources, most work, from the network's
//      compiled-in anchor - directory.js chainAnchorFor);
//   2. the round's census as evidence from GET /census, every entry checked against those headers and the set against
//      the round's census_root (arena-protocol client-committee.js);
//   3. the beacon off the same headers, and the seat's own sortition.
// The nodes' /committee answers are still read, and only compared: a seat naming another set is named in the answer.
// Kept per census and committee time: every round of a series shares them, so a series' second join asks nothing new.
