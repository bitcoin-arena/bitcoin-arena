// WHERE TO TALK, AND WHY.
//
// Section 25.1: "A client finds nodes by reading Bitcoin. There is no
// directory, no relay network and no seed list belonging to this protocol."
// This file is the client's half of step 4 - "where do I reach them? the
// NodeAdvertisement, carried by the bond funding transaction".
//
// WHAT IT REPLACES. The endpoint used to be `BLWP_NODE`, a page global. Every
// stranger who loaded the page reached whatever address whoever shipped the
// page had written into it, and there was nothing in the client that could
// tell a real node from any other server. Section 25.1 is normative about
// exactly that: a client "MUST NOT take a census, a committee or an endpoint on
// the word of any API, including one operated by the same party that ships the
// client", because "there is no symptom to notice and nothing for the player to
// check".
//
// A PAGE MAY STILL CARRY THE BYTES. That is not the same thing and it is the
// whole design: the page hands over a transaction, a branch and headers, and
// none of those are things it can choose. The txid is computed from the
// transaction, the branch has to rebuild a header's own merkle root, and the
// endpoint is only read out of a body an output of that transaction commits
// to. A page that swaps the endpoint is refused by name.
//
// WHAT IS STILL MISSING, AND IT IS NOT THIS SLICE. Where the headers come from.
// One source cannot be weighed: "block headers from several independent
// sources, most work wins", and then "a list provider can omit but not forge,
// and omission is answered by asking a second one". `mostWork` is here and takes
// as many chains as it is given - nothing fetches yet, and until something does,
// a client is only as sure as the chain it was handed.

 * round is played on.
 *

 * bonded, header-proven node with no standing in this round and the client
 * would open the round there and publish its whole section 11 transcript to a
