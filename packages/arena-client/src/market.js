// A MARKET IN THE PAGE (kanban #206 slice 2, §0A.7a; Daniel 2026-10-07, decisions A and B of plan 777): the pick sheet's
// model, the pick handed to the seats, the outcome checked by the page itself, and the lines the lobby draws.
//
// - The sheet (#blwp-pick in index.html) is drawn from `pickSheet`: one button per outcome, the stake, the 5% fee line and
//   the 0-5% donation line. Outcome labels and attestor keys come from the page's PINNED known-games list (`marketOf`),
//   never from a node; a market the page does not pin is read from its signed manifest (GET /game-manifest, checked to hash
//   to the round's game id) and staked on only after the second confirmation (§0A.6) - `needsConfirm`.
// - A pick plays no run: the page hands the entry and its locks to the seats itself (`submitPick`), no session opens, and
//   the join ends in state `picked` - Unity does not take it over.
// - The outcome is the seats' GET /outcome, but believed only once its attestation verifies against the attestors the page
//   pinned (`checkAttestation`, Ed25519 through WebCrypto); otherwise it is shown as unverified and nothing is concluded.
