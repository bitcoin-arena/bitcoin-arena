// WHERE A WINNER'S WINNINGS ARE SENT (RULED Daniel 2026-09-23: winnings are always sent; a qualifier who names no
// address is not paid, its share pooled over those who did).
//
// ONCE, AT THE RUN'S END, AND ONLY TO A QUALIFIER. On the existing BLWP_RUN_OVER hook the page asks the player one
// question, and only when its own core says DELIVERED with a score at or above the round's min_score. The key
// `arena.winnings.asked.<round>.<entry>` is written BEFORE the prompt, so a reload - or the hook firing twice, which
// it does - never asks again. A wreck, a forfeit or a score below min_score is asked nothing and posts nothing.
//
// WHAT IS SIGNED IS THE ADDRESS AND NOTHING ELSE: its UTF-8 bytes, by the entry's session key, through the bridge's
// one narrow call (`run.signAddress`) - no score, no payout, no round id. That is what the signer nodes' door checks.
//
// EVERY SIGNER NODE OF THE ROUND IS TOLD, not the gateways: each builds the settlement from the addresses it holds
// itself, and a node missing one rebuilds other amounts and refuses the plan. So an accepted address is kept as
// `arena.winnings.addr.<round>.<entry>` - the address, its signature, the round's nodes and which of them answered
// 201 - and on every load the page posts the SAME signed bytes again to the nodes that did not, and to no other,
// until every one has. Empty, cancelled or not an address: nothing is kept and nothing is posted; the share is
// pooled by the settlement.
