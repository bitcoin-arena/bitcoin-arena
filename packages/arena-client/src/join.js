// THE ROUND A PAGE WAS SENT TO, NAMED IN ITS OWN URL.
//
// The page has always refused to invent a round: `BLWP_ROUND` is undefined in
// the shipped template, on the written ground that "a round contract is agreed
// before anyone moves, and inventing one in the page would be inventing a
// lobby". That refusal stays exactly as it is. What was missing is the other
// half - there was NO WAY AT ALL to hand a shipped page a round that already
// exists, so two people could not join one, and the whole multiplayer path was
// unreachable from the daily however correct it was underneath.
//
// So: the same family as `?practice=0`. A URL may NAME things that exist - a
// round id, the daemons holding it, where headers and the bond can be asked
// for - and this resolves those names into the three globals the jslib reads.
// Nothing here mints a round, a contract, a committee or an id.
//
// AND THE NODE IS NOT TAKEN AT ITS WORD. A daemon asked for round X answers
// with bytes; those bytes are hashed here and must BE X, or they are refused.
// Without that the query would be an instruction to play whatever contract the
// first server felt like returning - a different stake, a different committee,
// a different core hash - which is precisely the substitution the round id
// exists to prevent. Same rule as the entry a resuming client re-hashes.

 * is a stake that is lost, which is worse than one never dealt.
 *
 * ASKED OF EVERY NODE AND REFUSED ON DISAGREEMENT, exactly as the randomness
 * is: one node's answer about who may open a player's stake is one node
 * choosing who may open it.

/**
 * THE PAGE AS DEALER. 23.1 step 1 and 2, and the half letter 29 left named.
 *
 * The player chooses P, publishes `sha256(P)` as the stake commitment their
 * hold invoice is issued against, splits P 5-of-7 over the settlement
 * committee and seals one share to each signer node. Nobody else ever sees P: the
 * page is where it is generated and the page is where it is forgotten.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS AN INPUT DEVICE AND NOT A SIMULATOR. Nothing here computes an
 * outcome, reads a truck, or decides what a run came to. It generates key
 * material and encodes it. The core stays where it is.
 *
 * THE CURVE IS INJECTED, exactly like `sign` and `verify`: this bundle carries
 * no crypto on purpose, because a vendored curve sitting in the page is an
 * implementation of the thing that pins money that nobody audits. The caller
 * hands in `pointFromScalar`, `combinePoints` and `ecdhShared`.
 *
 * P IS NOT REDUCED. About one preimage in 2^128 is not below the group order,
 * and the answer is another preimage rather than this one taken modulo n -
 * reducing would change the number the payment hash already commits to, and
 * the shares would then open something the Entry Contract does not name.
