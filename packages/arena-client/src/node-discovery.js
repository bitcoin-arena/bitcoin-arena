// THE NODES, FOUND ON THE FLY (kanban #351, Daniel 2026-10-13: "The client may not have a hard coded node list it must be found on
// the fly"). A page starts from any node it can reach (a bootstrap, not a list), and every census it checks itself - each entry's
// bond and advertisement proved against headers it agreed (client-committee.js) - names the network's nodes: each bond's
// advertisement carries the node's endpoint. Those are the nodes this page talks to from then on, kept for its next start.
