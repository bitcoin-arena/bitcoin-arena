// A PAGE OPENS ITS NEXT ROUND FROM THE CHAIN IT ALREADY PROVED (Daniel 2026-09-18 16:45).
//
// Measured in two real browsers on the Daily: on PLAY again both tabs joined the second round and neither got a
// client. The page proves a chain over /headers from both signer nodes and wants both inside 10 s; in a tab drawing
// under a frame a second that read took 8746 ms and 8745 ms for 240 bytes, where curl on the same host has them in
// 0.52 s and 1.43 s. A round joined with no client publishes nothing, so the other tab is shown no truck at all.
//
// The headers do not change behind a page, so the round that follows is opened from what the last one proved. What is
// NOT reused is the bond: it is checked against the chain every time, and a bond the kept proof cannot reach makes
// this read the chain afresh rather than play under a chain that cannot carry it.
