// THE BYTES C# READS, DRIVEN HERE.
//
// `blwp.jslib` is the file `node --test` cannot load, and that is not a small
// thing: the session's state word lived in it, was wrong on the socket-up VOID
// path, and survived an audit that was looking straight at it. The word has
// moved into the client where the other tests read it - and what is left here
// is the boundary itself, the three exports the game calls.
//
// So they are evaluated. The file is one `mergeInto(LibraryManager.library,
// {...})` call, which is an object literal: given a `mergeInto` that keeps
// what it is handed, every export becomes an ordinary function this file can
// call with a real `Client` behind it. Nothing is mocked that matters - the
// client is a real one against a real node, and what is stubbed is Emscripten.
// A FREE ROUND (RULED Daniel 2026-09-25): nothing this file asserts depends on the stake, and a paying round opens only
// on a signer node that reaches a federation now.
