// TOR FOR THE NODE'S LIGHTNING (kanban #471, Daniel 2026-10-18: "find a way to connect to it via a tunnel" / "connect via tor to the
// other nodes as well"): Lightning peers speak their own protocol over TCP, which no web tunnel carries, and most nodes take no
// connection (no open port, a dynamic address). So the node runs Tor and its LND runs hybrid: a permanent onion address others dial,
// clearnet peers still dialled directly. The federation's channel ring and the gateway's outside channel reach every node this way.
// The release carries the Tor Project's expert bundle (runtime/tor/); a linux-arm64 machine uses the system's tor (none is built).
