// HOW MUCH ROOM COVER HAS - the X side of WAR_TACTICS.md §0's "wrecks and craters are used" row (§11.3),
// measured on the tree that is deployed today, and the answer to Daniel's own question: how many of today's
// deaths happen where a place would have existed.
//
// §11.3 is a declared GAP - no TAC_COVER word, no places, no claims - so "is anyone on a place" is expected to be
// nil. The numbers that decide what this letter is worth are the other two:
//
//   1. of the men killed BY FIRE, the share that had a free place within 12 m when they died
//   2. of all ticks, the share on which a place existed at all within 12 m of a living man
//
// The places are the spec's own (§11.3), computed here because the core has none:
//   a wreck (a dead armour index, its hull words keeping the place it died) has 2:
//       (wreck x +- 2 m, wreck z + side x 3.6 m)
//   a crater has 4, on the near lip 1 m inside it:
//       centre + (R - 1 m) x (sin a, side x cos a), a = -50, -20, +20, +50 degrees from the seam normal
//
// TWO THINGS MAKE THIS A FLOOR, and both are stated rather than hidden. A CANDLE LIP IS NOT COUNTED: §11.3 gives
// one place every 4 m along a plateau edge standing between a man's post and the enemy, and that geometry scrolls
// with the chart. And the 12 m is measured from where the man IS, not from his post: §11.3 measures from the post
// "so a man does not wander to cover", and reconstructing every rifleman's post needs his squad anchor and his own
// scatter. A man is near his post, so the two differ by metres, and both simplifications can only make the
// denominator LARGER than the spec's - so a small number here is a real ceiling on what cover can do.
