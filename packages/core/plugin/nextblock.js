// the game's manifest as its developer signed it with the dev client (public bytes, nextblock-manifest.js), its id, and the cores the node installed for it (truck-cores.js, what was
// blwp-node/src/cores.js's truck half). The engine imports none of this; it reads a game through its manifest
// (protocol/src/manifest.js) and a core through its adapter, as blwp-node/src/plugins.js hands them on.
