// The obstacles are uploaded by the host as round setup, the same status as
// the relief - they are the boxes Unity is ACTUALLY colliding with, harvested
// from the scene, rather than a second description of the building that could
// disagree with the first.
//
// Boxes are axis-aligned in XZ, which every static collider in this game is,
// and carry their vertical span so the truck can drive UNDER a doorway lintel
// instead of into it.
