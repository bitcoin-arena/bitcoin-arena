// THE ROUND ENDS WHEN THE TIMER DOES (Daniel 2026-09-20 16:21).
//
// "When the round timer hits 0, the game must end and return to the lobby by itself. It used to. It no longer
// does." This is the CORE half of that: whatever the client then chooses to draw, the core must stop calling the
// run live once the block's ticks are spent. `gate.js` returns RUN_MISSED as soon as `tickInBlock >= BLOCK_TICKS`
// and `sim.js` feeds it `S_ELAPSED`, which only counts while the run is live.
//
// The client half is pinned in Unity by SplashScreen's ShouldReturnToLobby, because a core word nobody acts on is
// how this broke: the hold clock asked "core OR client", the lobby gate asked only "client".
