// THE COIN STACKS ARE SOLID, AND THE FINISH IS STILL DRIVEABLE (Daniel 2026-09-20 18:56).
//
// Photographed twice: the truck nose-deep inside a gold coin stack at the miner, the camera inside the coins.
// "The gold coin construct at the miner blocks the finish. Daniel cannot drive through to DELIVERED ... the
// truck must not clip through this construct from either side. The finish line / DeliveryGate must stay fully
// driveable. Do not grow the coin box over the gate. Do not leave the coin as air."
//
// Those are three separate claims and this drives all three, from the core and never from PhysX:
//   1. the centre line still reaches the gate and still says DELIVERED
//   2. a truck driving east into a stack stops west of it
//   3. a truck driving west into the same stack stops east of it
//
// The stacks stand at x 173.6 .. 192.4 and |z| 40.6 .. 59.4, measured off the .glb through DeliveryGate's own
// turn and height scale. The gate is at MINER_X 169 on the centre line with a 40 m mouth either side, so the
// boxes begin PAST the gate and 0.6 m OUTSIDE the mouth: test 1 is what proves they did not grow over it.

// driving WEST it went straight out of the back of the building and across the map to x -180.22, the west edge.
//
// The mouths are closed on the shell's own plane now, so the face a truck meets is the wall's east face at
// POST_X -114.40. That is where the yellow marks stand: every part drawn in `bumper_guard_yellow` on this
// facade, the `port_guard_post_*` at each mouth, spans x -114.95 .. -113.94. The line did not move.
