// THE ARRIVAL CARD'S FIXTURE IS WHAT THE CORE PRODUCES NOW (Daniel 2026-09-25: the card prints the core's E, T and C, and
// their product is the score). test/fixtures/arrival-card-runs.json is what the EditMode check
// TheCardsProductIsTheCoresScore feeds through the real C# formatter; if the core moved and the file did not, that check
// would be proving the card against a world nobody plays. Regenerate with tools/arrival-card-runs.mjs.
