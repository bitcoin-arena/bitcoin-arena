 * billion, and a cube root turns that into a factor of ten instead of the
 * 31.6 a square root would give. Both ends are quantities this core already
 * names rather than numbers picked to taste - `BOMB_RADIUS`, 16 m, at one
 * million, and the 40 m front band at a thousand.
 *
 * DEPTH IS 0.225 OF THE RADIUS, AND THAT NUMBER IS MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. The
 * geologist's ratio for a simple crater is a fifth of the diameter - 0.4 of
 * the radius - and at 0.4 the truck is trapped: driven from the centre at
 * full throttle it never leaves a 100 M crater or a 1000 M one in forty
 * seconds, and takes 36.2 s to crawl out of the smallest.
 *
 * The wall's steepest gradient is exactly 2 * D/R. Driven up a constant slope
 * the truck holds 0.45 - 2.03 m/s uphill - and at 0.50 it slides backwards.
 * So D/R must be under 0.225, and this sits ON that limit rather than half of
 * it. A hole a player cannot see is not a crater, and 0.15 was the cautious
 * end of the same rule rather than a second measurement.
 *
 * The whole ladder was driven again, from the crater floor at full throttle,
 * to find where the wall actually beats the truck rather than where the
 * arithmetic says it should:
 *
 *   D/R 0.150   1000 M floor  -6.00 m   out after  5.3 s
 *   D/R 0.180   1000 M floor  -7.20 m   out after  5.4 s
 *   D/R 0.200   1000 M floor  -8.00 m   out after  5.5 s
 *   D/R 0.225   1000 M floor  -9.00 m   out after  5.7 s
 *   D/R 0.250   1000 M floor -10.00 m   out after 10.8 s
 *   D/R 0.300   1000 M floor -12.00 m   NEVER out in 40 s
 *
 * So the cliff is between 0.25 and 0.30, and 0.225 costs 0.4 s over 0.15.
 * Doubling was asked for and is not available: at 0.30 the truck cannot leave
 * the largest crater at all. A crater is ground to be driven, not a hole to
 * be caught in.
 *
 * Lifetime rides the same root, so one rule sets both: ten rounds at the

 *                   `Rand(5, 11)`, and the crossing of a 1 M crater is

 *                   attempt used 4 a second on an integral guessed from the
 *                   10 M crossing and cost 14.0, outside it; the constant
 *                   follows the measurement rather than the estimate.

 * the lifetime ride, recovered from the stored radius so it costs no state
 * word. One rule, four consequences.
 *

 * WHAT WENT ON THE BED. AN INPUT, AND THE ONLY WAY HEAT IS EVER SET.

 * `BlwpSetHeat`. Two faults in one door, and the second is letter 40.
 *
 * The first is that the rule was in two places. `rules/cargo.js` has carried
 * `heat(feeSats, btcHundredths)` - the same rule in integers - since the port,
 * with ZERO CALLERS, while the float copy decided the game. It has a caller
 * now and the float copy is gone.
 *
 * The second is that a host write is in no batch, mark or transcript. The
 * page's core carried 57229 and any replay of the same transcript carried 0,
 * so every committee, and every GHOST a committee draws, walked a run the war
 * was hunting less hard than it hunted the player. Measured on one drive: the
 * two agree to tick 400 and are 7.217 m apart by tick 900, growing, because
 * heat is what decides the range a tank notices the truck at.
 *
 * So the LOAD crosses, not the heat: two integers a host honestly knows, in a
 * batch, at the tick they were declared - the same shape as a liquidation,
 * which is the other thing `step`'s five words do not carry. A replay applies
 * them at that tick and reaches the same heat by construction.
 *
 * Sats and hundredths of a BTC, both clamped by the rule itself.
