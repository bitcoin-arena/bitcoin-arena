// THE MAP'S OWN COLLISION BOXES, AND THEY BELONG HERE.
//
// The world solids used to be Unity's: `WorldSolids.Gather` collected every
// BoxCollider the player had BUILT AT RUNTIME and `CoreDrivenTruck.UploadSolids`
// sent them to the core - re-sending whenever the count changed, so the world
// the core resolved against moved mid-run as models streamed in. No replay set
// any at all, so a committee resolved every drive against nothing. Measured:
// one box on the path moves a 600-tick drive 40.233 m, more than the 33.500 m
// the ground was worth.
//
// So the boxes are made here, from the map's own geometry, the same way the
// relief is. THE NUMBERS ARE THE MAP'S and they were taken from a running
// player rather than from a reading of the code: 37 boxes, four map edges, the
// post office shell of twenty-five pillars on the bays' own 6.8 m pitch with
// its two ends and its lintel, and the miner's facade, lintel and tunnel
// sides. `SolidsInventoryTests` prints the set a real Bootstrap builds and
// pins it against these.
//
// EVERY HEIGHT IS SAMPLED FROM THE GROUND THIS CORE GENERATED. A shell sits at
// one terrain sample and the relief falls away to either side, which is why
// each one is buried: twenty metres of footing, so a truck cannot drive under
// a wall where the ground drops. That was Unity's reasoning and it is right;
// what changes is that the sample is now the core's own.
