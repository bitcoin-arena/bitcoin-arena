// THE MAP'S OWN COLLISION BOXES, AND THEY BELONG HERE.
//
// The world solids used to be Unity's: `WorldSolids.Gather` collected every
// BoxCollider the player had BUILT AT RUNTIME and `CoreDrivenTruck.UploadSolids`
// sent them to the core - re-sending whenever the count changed, so the world
// the core resolved against moved mid-run as models streamed in. No replay set
// any at all, so a committee resolved every drive against nothing. Measured:
// one box on the path moves a 600-tick drive 40.233 m, more than the 33.500 m
// the ground was worth.
//
// So the boxes are made here, from the map's own geometry, the same way the
// relief is. THE NUMBERS ARE THE MAP'S and they were taken from a running
// player rather than from a reading of the code: 37 boxes, four map edges, the
// post office shell of twenty-five pillars on the bays' own 6.8 m pitch with
// its two ends and its lintel, and the miner's facade, lintel and tunnel
// sides. `SolidsInventoryTests` prints the set a real Bootstrap builds and
// pins it against these.
//
// EVERY HEIGHT IS SAMPLED FROM THE GROUND THIS CORE GENERATED. A shell sits at
// one terrain sample and the relief falls away to either side, which is why
// each one is buried: twenty metres of footing, so a truck cannot drive under
// a wall where the ground drops. That was Unity's reasoning and it is right;
// what changes is that the sample is now the core's own.

  // ---- THE MINER'S CORRIDOR ------------------------------------------------
  //
  // MEASURED 2026-09-20: 452 of the miner's 904 drawn parts carried no box at all, 46 of them standing in the
  // entry corridor below a truck's height, and a truck driven down the lane passed 1.27 m - its FULL body
  // radius, through the middle and not a graze - through five of them on every one of five approaches. The five
  // boxes above are the facade and the tunnel's outer walls; they leave the corridor itself unlined, which is
  // why a tank can stand in a drawn cable.
  //
  // These are those parts, read from the model through Unity's own 180-degree turn and (1, 0.45, 1) scale and
  // written here in the units the core keeps. They are NOT a mesh collider and nothing was copied from the C#:
  // DeliveryGate's five Slab() calls still build the five above, and that agreement is left exactly as it was.
  //
  // WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and it is a ruling rather than an oversight (Daniel 2026-09-20):
  //   mass_behind_tunnel         hangs from y 2.7 m across the whole approach while the truck's body is 3.26 m,
  //                              so its roof passes 0.56 m through it. The delivery gate is at x 169, PAST that
  //                              mass at x 119..145, so a solid there closes the only route to the miner. The
  //                              ceiling is passable BY RULING, and the 0.56 m is Unity's (1, 0.45, 1) height
  //                              scale rather than a missing slab. Raising the miner is a later item.
  //   tunnel_end_backglow, tunnel_grid_h_0 and _h_1, tunnel_grid_v_5/6/7, btc_medallion_tunnel_end
  //                              the same thing at the tunnel mouth: measured, these seven span the driving lane
  //                              at truck height, and the gate is beyond them. A box on any of them closes the
  //                              route as surely as the mass does. Nothing solid stands within 6 m of the centre
  //                              line at truck height, so the run-in is always open.
