// about 180 m of x with a full bed doubling the multiplier - so a reference of
// 190 was reached at an AVERAGE THREAT OF 0.53. The threat map itself is well

 * THE FACTORS ON THE GRID THE CARD PRINTS, AND THE SCORE THEIR PRODUCT (Daniel 2026-09-25: "Their product is the score,
 * so the core's score is that product"; multiplayer_p2p.md §18A.3: score = 1000 · E · T · C).
 *
 * Each factor is an integer count of 1e-5 (FACTOR_SCALE), formed from the core's own word and rounded once, half up:
 *   E5 = S_EXPOSURE held to the 320 m reference, over that reference     0 .. 100000
 *   T5 = 1800 over S_ELAPSED held to 1200 .. 7200 ticks                  25000 .. 150000
 *   C5 = S_CARGO held to 0 .. ONE, over ONE                              0 .. 100000
 * and the score is 1000 · E · T · C of those, kept as an integer count of 1e-5 points (SCORE_SCALE): E5·T5·C5 / 1e7,
 * rounded once, half up. So the product of the factors as the card prints them, to five decimals, IS the score to five
 * decimals - one number, not a product beside a rounded one.
 *
 * WHAT MOVED, AND WHY: this returned whole points - 1000·E·T·C carried in Q16.16 and rounded to an integer at the end -
 * so a run whose exact product was 7.49984 scored 7 while its factors, printed to five decimals (E 0.02500, T 1.50000,
 * C 0.20000), multiplied to 7.50000: two numbers for one score. The factors now live on the printed grid and the score
 * is their product; nothing is floored or rounded to a whole point.
 *
 * Exact in JS numbers: E5·T5·C5 <= 1e5 · 1.5e5 · 1e5 = 1.5e15 < 2^53, and every quotient is an integer division of
 * integers under 2^53 whose fractional parts are at least 1/D apart - far wider than the division's own rounding.
 * A score of 1500 points is 150000000 in these units, well inside the i32 word and the result's u32.
