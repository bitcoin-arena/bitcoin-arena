// ARMOUR TACTICS - WAR_TACTICS.md at the repo root is the spec (Daniel 2026-09-16 18:20). This file is its
// implementation; the army step (rules/army.js) only moves a tank to what is handed out here.
//
// Deterministic: every value is an integer function of the round seed word, the tank's roster slot index, the tick
// and the words in O_TACTICS. No draw is taken, so no stream shifts, and every signer node computes the same bits.
//
//   §2 ASSIGNMENT    stable pairs by sorted roster id per side: (0,1), (2,3) ... - never re-paired from the living.
//                    An odd tank is a singleton OVERWATCH on its own slot. In a pair one OVERWATCH, one BOUNDING;
//                    they swap on a period and phase hashed from (seed, side, team) - bounding overwatch.
//                    FRONTAGE: seven slots a side, 27 m apart, a permutation hashed from (seed, side) hands each team a distinct
//                    one; the two sides' permutations are independent - crossfire.
//   §3 DEATH         a widow holds OVERWATCH on the team's slot, no rush. A respawned id rejoins its own pair as
//                    BOUNDING, the partner already holding: the team's role clock restarts with it bounding. Teams
//                    are roster ids, so a new hull never takes another team's partner.
//   §4 WHEN          default hold: hull-down on the overwatch line, reverse slope (rules/army.js picks the spot
//                    behind the crest). After a shot: shoot-and-scoot to the next free slot beside the team, the
//                    side hashed - not away from the truck. Moving between slots the pair keeps its two depth lines:
//                    a staggered column, not bumper to bumper.
//   §1.2 THE TRUCK   nothing here reads the truck. The army shoots it; a touch wrecks it (sim.js).
//
// There is no road in the core: the kill zone every slot covers is the seam band the truck has to cross.
