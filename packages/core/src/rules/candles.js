// ruling B); each body as wide as its slot, bodies touching; a body runs from its open (the previous candle's close - a
// continuous staircase) to its close in z, at least 1 m long. The union of the bodies is a ribbon 1 m above the ground,
// its every free edge a 4 m ramp at 25%: h = H x clamp(d / R, 0, 1), d the distance to the union's boundary. Nothing in
// the chart is a solid - no wall, no wick collider (w1 withdrawn): the chart is the road. The wick and the glow are light.
// It moves: the scroll slides it toward the post office half a slot per sample (frontline.js `scrollOf`), and a new
// window high or low lerps the price-to-z scale over the 300 ticks after the sample. Derived, not hashed: the tape, the
// samples taken and the market words make it.
