  // and z on separate controllers, deliberately: coupling them into one
  // normalised vector was tried, measured and reverted, because the z
  // component then gets dragged along by the size of the x chase and the front
  // loses its depth. The price of keeping them apart is that the direction of
  // travel jitters, so a hull that merely CHASES it still ends up 45.7 degrees
  // off on average - measured, better than 90.5 and not the rule.
