# LIVE CHROME PLAYTESTS RUN ON DANIEL'S MACBOOK, NOT ON THIS BOX (Daniel 2026-09-18 19:05, HARD).
#
# Beelink carries bitcoind, the signer daemons and every build; two headless WebGL players on top of that drew under
# one frame a second, and measurements taken there kept catching the starved tab rather than the game - a chain read
# that answers in 0.52 s to curl took 8.7 s inside such a tab, past the client's ten second budget. The Mac has a
# Metal GPU and no SwiftShader, so a page there runs at a player's speed.
#
# RETIRED BY RULING (Daniel 2026-09-20 15:12): "Live Chrome playtests run on the Beelink only. Do not use
# the MacBook." This script IS the MacBook path, so its 9341/9342 are left alone - they are what it talks
# to - but nothing should be driven through it any more. The Beelink's two playtest Chromes are 9351 and
# 9352, and every probe and suite defaults to those now.
#
#   start    the two headless-shell browsers on the Mac (CDP 9341 and 9342), through its own launcher
#   stop     both of them
#   status   what the Mac says it is running
#   tunnel   forward 9341/9342 from the Mac to this box, so a probe here drives the browsers there
