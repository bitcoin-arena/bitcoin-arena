-- "Bitcoin Arena.app": a stay-open applet (osacompile -s, package-mac.sh). While its installer runs it stays open, in the Dock with the
-- running dot (kanban #635, Daniel's playtest 2026-10-25: "doesn't stay open, doesn't have an icon that indicates that it is running").
-- A click on its Dock icon shows the dialog again; Quit asks whether the installer keeps running. When the installer is done it says so
-- and quits. A node already set up: its status, with Owner page / Restart / Close. Each step is the helper arena-node-app beside it.
